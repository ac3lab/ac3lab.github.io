In this first post, we will discuss two statistics: the winning percentage and a variation of it called the Pythagorean expectation. The data used will be from the latest seasons of major European leagues (23-24) and the Brazilian league (24), extracted from the FBREF website. <br/><br/> <h3> <b> What is the Pythagorean Expectation? </b> </h3> The Pythagorean expectation is an analytical formula initially used in baseball. It was created by Bill James, a renowned statistician and pioneer in sports data analysis, who wrote dozens of books studying baseball through statistics to determine why teams win or lose. This formula aims to estimate the percentage of games a team should have won based on the number of runs they scored and allowed. In football, the equivalent would be goals scored and goals conceded. <br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-02-12-post_pitagorica_1/image1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center>The name of the statistic comes from the similarity of its formula to the Pythagorean theorem. <br/><br/></center> Comparing a team's winning percentage with its Pythagorean expectation can help evaluate which teams are performing above expectations and which are underperforming. <br/><br/> <h3> <b> The Research </b> </h3> The data used consists of a table with all match results from each league's season, collected from <a href="https://fbref.com/pt/comps/24/cronograma/Serie-A-Resultados-e-Calendarios">FBREF</a>. <br/><br/> <h3> <b> Data Preparation and Defining Percentages </b> </h3> After extracting the data and performing basic table cleaning, the result is a DataFrame in the following format. A season consists of 380 matches, and to calculate the winning percentage and the Pythagorean expectation, we need the following information: the match result determines the team's winning percentage, while goals scored and conceded define the Pythagorean expectation. <br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-02-12-post_pitagorica_1/image2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center>This is the way the data is extracted from FBREF. <br/><br/></center> We separated each team's goals and determined the winner of each match. This allows us to calculate the winning percentage—where a win is worth 1, a draw is worth 0.5, and a loss is worth 0. The sum of these values is then divided by the number of games played (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_percentage">Wikipedia</a>). <br/><br/> After adjusting the table and calculating the teams' winning percentages, we split the data into the First Half and Second Half of the season, meaning before and after matchday 20. The table for the First Half of the season looks like this: <br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-02-12-post_pitagorica_1/image3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center> G: Number of matches played; W: Win value, used for calculating the winning percentage; GF: Goals scored; GA: Goals conceded; wpc: Winning percentage <br/><br/></center> To finalize our table, we calculate the Pythagorean expectation and merge the First and Second Half tables according to each team. <br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-02-12-post_pitagorica_1/image4.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center> Values with <b>x</b> refer to the First Half, and values with <b>y</b> refer to the Second Half. <br/><br/></center> Code for Calculating wpc and pyth: <br/> <br/> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1

The line represents a linear regression fitted to the data, showing the relationship between the two variables. <br/><br/></center> But what we really want to know is: which of these statistics has a stronger relationship with a team’s winning percentage at the end of the season? To analyze this, we can generate a correlation table comparing these statistics between the First Half and Second Half of the season. <br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-02-12-post_pitagorica_1/image6.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center> Premier League correlation table. <br/><br/></center> As seen in the highlighted values, <b>pythagorean_x</b> has a stronger correlation with <b>win_percentage_y</b> (0.80) than <b>win_percentage_x</b> with <b>win_percentage_y</b> (0.75). While this difference is small, it suggests that the Pythagorean expectation has slightly better predictive power than the winning percentage. This is the result for the Premier League. What about other leagues? <br/><br/> <h4> <b> Bundesliga </b></h4> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-02-12-post_pitagorica_1/image7.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center> Bundesliga correlation table. <br/><br/></center> <h4> <b> La Liga </b></h4> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-02-12-post_pitagorica_1/image8.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center> La Liga correlation table. <br/><br/></center> <h4> <b> Serie A </b></h4> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-02-12-post_pitagorica_1/image9.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center> Serie A correlation table. <br/><br/></center> <h4> <b> Ligue One </b></h4> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-02-12-post_pitagorica_1/image10.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center> Ligue One correlation table. <br/><br/></center> As observed, in the German, Spanish, and Italian leagues, the values are slightly lower, but the Pythagorean expectation still has better predictive power than the winning percentage. In the French league, despite the correlation between First Half and Second Half results being below 50%, the Pythagorean expectation still outperforms the winning percentage. So far, everything aligns with expectations. However, things get interesting when we analyze the Brazilian league. <br/><br/> <h4> <b> Brasileirão </b></h4> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-02-12-post_pitagorica_1/image11.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center> Brasileirão correlation table. <br/><br/></center> In the Brazilian league, not only do First Half values have less than 30% correlation with Second Half results, but the winning percentage also has a <b>higher correlation</b> than the Pythagorean expectation! This is the only one of the six leagues studied where this phenomenon occurs. <br/><br/> <h2> <b> Conclusion </b></h2> Based on the experiment’s results, we decided to analyze how much team performance fluctuates between the two halves of the season, depending on the league, to better understand the most ‘unpredictable’ leagues. To do this, we calculated the mean and median of this variation across all studied leagues. The <b>Brasileirão stood out as the competition with the highest fluctuation between halves</b>, surpassing European leagues. Surprisingly, La Liga showed a relatively high variation for European standards. <br/><br/> <table> <thead> <tr> <th style="color: white;">Leagues</th> <th style="color: white;">Median Performance Difference</th> <th style="color: white;">Mean Performance Difference</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="color: white;">Premier League</td> <td style="color: white;">20.78%</td> <td style="color: white;">27.13%</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="color: white;">La Liga</td> <td style="color: white;">21.64%</td> <td style="color: white;">36.83%</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="color: white;">Ligue 1</td> <td style="color: white;">23.25%</td> <td style="color: white;">32.35%</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="color: white;">Série A</td> <td style="color: white;">18.61%</td> <td style="color: white;">27.39%</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="color: white;">Bundesliga</td> <td style="color: white;">21.30%</td> <td style="color: white;">26.35%</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="color: white;">Brasileirão</td> <td style="color: white;">32.14%</td> <td style="color: white;">38.76%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br/><br/> <h4>Performance Difference Calculation:</h4> \[ \left( \frac{\text{Second Half Performance}}{\text{First Half Performance}} - 1 \right) \times 100\% \] <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-02-12-post_pitagorica_1/image12.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center> variation in Brazilian clubs’ performances between the First and Second Halves of the Brasileirão. <br/><br/></center> The graph above illustrates the high variation in Brazilian clubs’ performances between the First and Second Halves of the Brasileirão. Teams like Vitória, Grêmio, Fluminense, and Corinthians had poor results in the first half but above-average performances in the second half. Meanwhile, Atlético Mineiro, Cruzeiro, and Bahia performed well in the first half but declined in the second. Why does this happen? <br/><br/> We can speculate on some possible reasons, such as increased investment over time, frequent coaching changes, or fan pressure after poor results, which forces club management to invest more in reinforcements. However, determining the real cause would require a more in-depth study on the subject. <br/><br/> In the next post, we will discuss predicting outcomes based on the clubs' market value, which will be our primary variable.

The event featured 5km and 15km routes and is renowned for the significant challenges in the longer-distance course: nearly 4km of uphill segments, with certain points becoming quite steep. </p> <p align="justify"> A total of 1.973 runners completed the race, with 1.010 in the 5km course and 963 in the 15km course. Here's an interesting detail: in the shorter distance, the majority of participants were women (around 63%), while in the longer distance, the majority were men, with women accounting for 38% of the participants. </p> <p align="justify"> As it is well known that weather conditions can directly impact athletes performance, it's worth noting that the race started at 6:30am and that during the event, the sky was heavily overcast, with occasional drizzle. According to some participants, the early start time combined with the weather conditions contributed positively to their performance on the course, as December tends to be very hot in Niterói. </p> <p>Let’s dive into the analysis!</p> <p align="justify"> The goal of this post is to analyze the performance of some participants to shed light on and validate certain hypotheses that we already know from other studies and related work. </p> <p align="justify"> Ten athletes who participated in the race and used the <a href="https://www.strava.com/">Strava</a> app provided consent to participate in the analysis and shared the race data collected by the app. This dataset includes information such as speed, distance, compass, and more. Additionally, the volunteer runners completed a brief questionnaire containing details about their training, race preparation, and experience. </p> <p>In general, regarding the participants:</p> <ul> <li>All of them had a habit of running and practicing other exercises;</li> <li>Only 4 had previously run the race course;</li> <li>9 out of the 10 participants prepared for the race in a more comprehensive manner.</li> </ul> <h2>Exploratory</h2> <p align="justify"> The data extracted from Strava and provided by the participants were imported into Python for a more detailed exploratory analysis. It is important to note that we removed 2 runners from the analysis due to inconsistent data — most likely caused by GPS data capture failures during the race. </p> <p align="justify"> In the chart below, you can visualize the performance of each participant (average pace) by distance covered: </p> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-01-28-post_sao_garrafa/imagem_2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p align="justify"> Right from the start, runners 1, 5, 6, and 10 stand out for maintaining a low pace throughout the entire course — around 4'30" on average. Coincidence? Probably not, as these were the 4 runners who had trained on the race course before the event. To simplify the understanding from here on, we will refer to this group as the "course-savvy runners". This point highlights just how crucial preparation and knowledge of the course are before taking on a challenging race. </p> <p align="justify"> Notice that between kilometers 5 and 8, all athletes showed a decrease in their speeds (increase in pace). This is exactly the part of the course with a very steep uphill, where it is quite difficult to maintain the pace. Here, a statistical test was conducted to compare the pace of the course-savvy runners with those who were not familiar with the course, and it can be stated that there is a statistically significant difference (p-value &lt; 0.05) in the speeds of these two groups at this segment of the course. </p> <p align="justify"> In this other chart, it's also possible to visualize the performance of each participant, but now by race time. Once again, the course-savvy runners stand out for, unsurprisingly, being the ones to finish the race the fastest. </p> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-01-28-post_sao_garrafa/imagem_1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p align="justify"> In general, the course-savvy runners were at a walking speed (established here as 5 km/h) less frequently compared to the non-savvy runners. Another point that reinforces the idea that "more trained" athletes naturally perform better is their experience time. The course-savvy runners have an average of 5 years of running experience each, while the non-savvy runners have an average of 1 year. </p> <p align="justify"> It was also possible to compare performance by elevation range (in meters), as shown in the chart below. Runners 1 and 5 stand out for their minimal pace fluctuations as the elevation level increases, demonstrating their ability to maintain a nearly constant pace, as shown above. A previous study delves deeper into this point, suggesting that more experienced runners show fewer fluctuations in their speed series, meaning fewer abrupt changes.

It is likely that their prior knowledge of the course allowed these runners to better adapt to the challenges. It is important to mention that there are other variables not considered in this analysis, such as nutrition, injury history, age, body anatomy, among others, which, according to the literature, also influence the results. </p> <p align="justify"> Our goal was to illustrate in a real case how some of these variables are connected and to raise the challenge for future work considering other influencing factors for performance evaluation—and even prediction. </p> <p>Any suggestions are welcome!</p> <h2>References</h2> <p>https://neorace.com.br/resultados/g-live.html?f=2024%2Fdez%2Fsgf%2Fsgf.clax</p> <p>TITO, Nathália; PAIXÃO, Balthazar; TAVARES, Lucas G.; OGASAWARA, Eduardo; AMORIM, Glauco F..

This time, we'll be using data that takes into account all 38 rounds of the championship (in the first post, the championship was still in its 29th round). <br/><br/> It's worth noting that we'll continue to focus our analysis on the players selected using the criteria explained in the <a href="https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2024/post_contratacoes_1_en/"> last post</a>: <b> Luiz Henrique </b> (Botafogo), <b> Felipe Anderson </b> (Palmeiras), <b> Gustavo Scarpa </b> (Atlético-MG), <b> Breno Lopes </b> (Fortaleza), <b> André Silva </b> (São Paulo), <b> Everton Ribeiro </b> (Bahia), <b> Gabriel Veron </b> (Cruzeiro), <b> David </b> (Vasco), <b> Soteldo </b> (Grêmio), <b> Wesley </b> (Internacional), <b> Rodrigo Garro </b> (Corinthians), <b> Yannick Bolasie </b> (Criciúma), <b> Lucas Barbosa </b> (Juventude) and <b> Gonzalo Mastriani </b> (Athletico). <br/><br/> In addition, we decided to include and focus the analysis on three more players who stood out during the year and fit the criteria used: <b> Alerrandro </b> (Vitória), <b> Memphis Depay </b> (Corinthians) and <b> Kevin Serna </b> (Fluminense). Finally, the players used for comparison will also be the same as in the last post and will be represented in yellow, while the signings will be represented in blue. <br/><br/> <h3> <b> Decisive goals and assists </b> </h3> To begin with, let's try to quantify the decision-making power of these players. To do this, we'll use the decisive goal participations metric, which counts <b> goals or assists that happened while the game was tied or while the player's team was losing by one goal </b>. <br/><br/> In the following graph, the red bar represents the number of decisive goal participations, while the blue bubble represents the number of total participations. <br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-12-16-post_contratacoes_2/decisiveGoalsAssists.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center>Graph 1. Decisive goal participations in red, and total goal participations in blue <br/><br/></center> - One player stands out in a very negative way: <b> Felipe Anderson </b> (Palmeiras). Especially for a player who came straight from one of Europe's big five leagues, a single decisive goal in 14 minutes can be considered a disappointing result. <br/><br/> - <b> Alerrandro </b> was one of the highlights of the Brasileirão. As well as being top scorer (tied with Corinthians' <b> Yuri Alberto </b>), he was extremely decisive for Vitória (especially in the final stretch, when he scored 8 decisive goals in the last 9 rounds), who finished in 11th place. <br/><br/> If we also take into account the number of minutes played, dividing the number of participations in goals by the number of games (90 minutes), the ranking changes shape a little, leaving room for new observations: <br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-12-16-post_contratacoes_2/decisivePer90.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center> Graph 2. Decisive participations in goals per 90 minutes in red, and total participations in goals per 90 minutes in blue <br/><br/></center> - From this graph, you can see the impact of <b> Memphis Depay </b>, from Corinthians, much more clearly. He was the signing with the most decisive appearances per game, as well as having an impressive 0.9 goals per game. It's worth noting that, after round 27 (<b> Memphis </b>' debut), Corinthians had won 28 out of a possible 33 points (84% points!). <br/><br/> - Even taking into account the ratio of decisive goals to minutes on the field, <b> Alerrandro </b> (24!) continues to lead the statistics among the selected signings, scoring approximately 1 decisive goal every two matches. <br/><br/> - Another player worth mentioning is <b> Kevin Serna </b>, from Fluminense. The Colombian arrived in the mid-year transfer window and was essential to his team's escape from relegation, scoring an average of one decisive goal every two matches. It's also worth mentioning that all of the Colombian's goal participations were decisive. <br/><br/> <h3> <b> General Analysis </b> </h3> In the graphs below, we have used the same model used in the first part of the series of posts. However, we've updated the data and also added the other players who fit the criteria to be selected (<b> Alerrandro </b>, <b> Memphis Depay </b> and <b> Kevin Serna </b>). <br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-12-16-post_contratacoes_2/totalShotsper90_vs_xGper90.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center> Graph 3. Total Shots per 90 minutes x Expected Goals per 90 minutes <br/><br/></center> - <b> Memphis Depay </b> is one of the players with the most shots per game in the league. However, it's interesting to note that this high number of shots is not reflected in expected goals. One interpretation is that <b> Memphis </b>, being a player with well above-average technical quality, attempts a lot of shots from outside the box or in difficult conditions, thus not accumulating a high number of expected goals. <br/><br/> - On the other hand, <b> Alerrandro </b> accumulates an average of expected goals per game very similar to <b> Memphis Depay </b>, even though he shoots considerably less, indicating less risk-taking and opting to shoot only when he is in clearer scoring conditions. In addition to this difference in characteristics, the positioning of the players on the pitch also influences this different behavior: <b> Alerrandro </b> is a center forward by trade, while <b> Memphis </b> is a second striker, forming attacking duos. <br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-12-16-post_contratacoes_2/xg_vs_goals.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center> Graph 4. Goals per 90 minutes vs. Expected Goals per 90 minutes <br/><br/></center> - Once again, we have to mention <b> Memphis Depay </b> as an individual highlight. Among the players considered (minutes equivalent to at least 8 games), <b> Memphis </b> was the second player with the most goals per game (as a matter of curiosity, the first was <b> Eduardo Vargas </b>, from Atlético-MG). However, it's not just the number of goals per game that's impressive, but also the player's efficiency. <b> Memphis </b> had 0.44 expected goals/game and 0.79 goals/game (almost double!). <br/><br/> - <b> André Silva </b>, from São Paulo, also deserves a mention. Despite initially being signed as a backup for the already established <b> Jonathan Calleri </b>, the Brazilian finished the league with more goals, even though he had fewer expected goals (taking into account the players' minutes), showing, at least in a quick analysis, that he was a more efficient striker than the Argentine. <br/><br/> <h2> <b> Conclusion </b></h2> In summary, this second part of the post shows a little more about the impact of some signings in the attacking sector of Brazilian soccer. While some stood out in an extremely positive way, such as <b> Memphis Depay </b> and <b> Alerrandro </b>, being decisive and essential to their respective teams' campaigns, other players didn't have the expected effect, such as <b> Felipe Anderson </b>, from Palmeiras. <br/><br/> Furthermore, our analysis showed that the simplest metrics we used, although useful in many contexts, have limitations in capturing the full impact of certain players. In order to understand the real impact of players like <b> Everton Ribeiro </b> and <b> Luiz Henrique </b>, for example, who have been essential to their teams, it is necessary to combine different types of metrics that consider different contexts, and it is also recommended to use other types of data, such as event data. In this way, we can evaluate not only direct production in raw numbers, but also less obvious (but no less important) contributions, such as playmaking and tactical influence. <br/><br/> <div> </div></div>]]></content><author><name>Ace Laboratory Football Team - Daniel Barros, Hugo Antunes</name></author><category term="Football;"/><category term="Analysis"/><category term="Football;"/><category term="Analysis"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Analyzing Brazilian Football Signings in 2024 - Offensive Sector</title><link href="https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2024/post_contratacoes_1_en/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Analyzing Brazilian Football Signings in 2024 - Offensive Sector"/><published>2024-10-10T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-10-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2024/post_contratacoes_1_en</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2024/post_contratacoes_1_en/"><![CDATA[<hr/> <p align="justify"> Se quiser ler este texto em pt-br, <a href="https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2000/post_contratacoes_1_pt/"> clique aqui.</a> </p> <h2><b>Introduction </b></h2> <div style="text-align: justify"> In this series of posts, we'll bring you statistics on the main signings made by teams in Brazil's Serie A! To do this, we've separated the players into sectors: attack, midfield and defense. In this first post, we'll talk about the attackers that Brazilian clubs have invested (some of them a lot of) money in. For a better comparison, we've also chosen to showcase some players who aren't 2024 signings, precisely to compare the new players with others already established in Brazilian soccer. <br/><br/> <h3> <b> The signings </b> </h3> Our criteria for selecting players was to choose the player recruited in 2024 with the most minutes in the team for each sector (with a minimum minute equivalent to 8 matches), prioritizing teams that have greater purchasing power and have made more significant signings in the elite of Brazilian soccer. The players selected for the attacking sector were: <b>Luiz Henrique</b> (Botafogo), <b>Felipe Anderson</b> (Palmeiras), <b>Gustavo Scarpa</b> (Atlético-MG), <b>Breno Lopes</b> (Fortaleza), <b>André Silva</b> (São Paulo), <b>Everton Ribeiro</b> (Bahia), <b>Gabriel Veron</b> (Cruzeiro), <b>David</b> (Vasco), <b>Soteldo</b> (Grêmio), <b>Wesley</b> (Internacional), <b>Rodrigo Garro</b> (Corinthians), <b>Yannick Bolasie</b> (Criciúma), <b>Lucas Barbosa</b> (Juventude) and <b>Gonzalo Mastriani</b> (Athletico). <br/><br/> Some clubs haven't made any signings in the attacking sector, while others have, but the signings haven't played more than the equivalent of 8 matches. In both cases, there is no player representing the team in the comparison. <br/><br/> <h3> <b> Analysis and Comparison of the New Players </b> </h3> The data used for this analysis refers exclusively to the Brazilian Championship, covering matches up to the 29th round. It is worth noting that, due to postponements, not all teams have played 29 matches. <br/><br/> To begin the analysis, we will use two graphs which, although similar in scope, offer different perspectives. The first graph relates the number of shots to the expected goals, providing an insight into the <b>quantity and quality of chances that players receive</b>, on average, per match. The second graph relates expected goals (xG) to goals scored, making it easier to analyze <b>how players take advantage of the chances created</b>. In both graphs (and the third one too), the players signed this season are represented in cyan, while the green dots indicate players used as references. <br/><br/> The first graph shows average lines on both axes, which helps to identify players who are above or below average in each metric, dividing the graph into four quadrants. In the Goals vs. xG graph, a single line was used, dividing the graph into two quadrants: above the line are the players who scored more goals than expected; below the line, those who scored less than expected. <br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-10-10-post_contratacoes/shots_vs_xg.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center>Graph 1. xG per 90 x Shots Per 90<br/><br/></center> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-10-10-post_contratacoes/xg_vs_goals.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center>Graph 2.

Does the Brasileirão belong among these leagues? We will analyze everything from the total Market Value to each league's performance in international competitions. The leagues studied were: Premier League (England), La Liga (Spain), Ligue 1 (France), Bundesliga (Germany), Serie A (Italy), and Brasileirão (Brazil). The international tournaments studied were the Copa Libertadores (CONMEBOL), Copa Sulamericana (CONMEBOL), Champions League (UEFA) and Europa League (UEFA). <br/><br/> <h2> <b>Research</b> </h2> The data used in this research were collected from Transfermarkt, which provides market values for each team in the leagues studied per season; Sofascore, with the final standings of each season; UEFA, with the results from the Champions League and Europa League; and CONMEBOL, with the results from the Copa Libertadores and Copa Sulamericana. The last five years were taken into consideration: for European teams, the seasons from 2019-2020 to 2023-2024, and for Brazilian teams, from 2019 to 2023. Scripts were used to extract data from Transfermarkt and Sofascore. <br/><br/> <h2> <b>Market Value</b> </h2> The following bar chart shows the total Market Value of the teams by league and by season. In the case of the Brasileirão, 19-20 refers to the 2019 season, 20-21 refers to the 2020 season, and so on. <br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-09-22-post_analise_ligas/marketvalue.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center>Image 1. Market Value of Leagues in the last 5 seasons<br/><br/></center> The difference between the Premier League and the other leagues is enormous, and the growth in market value per season is exponential. The financial model of team ownership in England may influence this, as many of the top English teams are owned by billionaires who inject money for signings. The model for distributing broadcast rights revenues also contributes to this high value, with hundreds of millions of pounds being distributed almost equally among the clubs. <br/><br/> Among the other European leagues, there isn’t much variation between seasons or among them. When comparing the European leagues to the Brasileirão, the colossal difference can be explained by various factors, from the weakness of the Brazilian Real compared to the Euro to the early sale of promising Brazilian players to European teams, often motivated by poor management of Brazilian clubs, forcing teams to sell promising players to pay off large debts. <br/><br/> <h2> <b>Performance in Unequal Matches</b> </h2> Performance in Unequal Matches (PUM) measures a team's performance in games against opponents whose market value is lower. The formula to calculate PUM is simple: divide the number of points won in these matches by the total points disputed. <br/><br/> Now that we understand what PUM is, let’s explain why it is useful. Our goal is to evaluate whether economically dominant teams also show sporting superiority, as they have better squads and infrastructure compared to their opponents in the leagues. <br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-09-22-post_analise_ligas/graficoACD.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center>Image 2. Average PUM chart for leagues in the last 5 seasons<br/><br/></center> Based on the chart showing the average PUM per season in each analyzed championship, we notice that, in the Brasileirão, performance in unequal matches is the lowest among the six leagues. This indicates that teams with lower market value can compete more evenly against the top national clubs. In the Premier League and Bundesliga, the trend is the opposite, with higher market value teams having a significantly higher average performance compared to the other leagues. <br/><br/> <h2> <b>International Competitions</b> </h2> The following tables show the number of defeats of Brazilian clubs by stage in the Copa Libertadores and Copa Sulamericana over the last 5 seasons. <br/><br/> <h3> <b>Copa Libertadores</b></h3> Brazil's dominance in the biggest club competition in South America is undeniable. In the last five finals, all featured Brazilian teams, three were entirely Brazilian, and five titles went to Brazil. The technical level difference between Brazil's top clubs and other South American teams can be attributed to several factors. Besides other countries being smaller and poorer than Brazil, some are going through major economic crises, such as Argentina, the country with the most titles in the "Glória Eterna" tournament. But Brazil has dominated in recent years, and the trend is likely to continue. Another possible analysis is the large number of talents exported from "smaller" Latin American countries to high-level Brazilian football, weakening their leagues' competitiveness against Brazilian giants. <br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-09-22-post_analise_ligas/tabelaliba.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center>Image 3. Number of Brazilian teams per stage of Libertadores by year<br/><br/></center> <h3> <b>Copa Sulamericana</b></h3> In the Copa Sulamericana, the scenario is different: in the last five finals, Brazil has "only" one title and three participations (with one all-Brazilian final). Why is this different from Libertadores? Could the large number of spots given to Brasileirão teams mean that weaker and less experienced teams are playing and losing early? However, this scheme may be about to change. Since 2019, the number of Brazilian clubs dropping out in the group stage has significantly decreased, replaced by later-stage eliminations. Additionally, since the all-Brazilian final in 2021, Brazil has participated in every final, although without further titles. <br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-09-22-post_analise_ligas/tabelasula.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center>Image 4. Number of Brazilian teams per stage of Sulamericana by year<br/><br/></center> The fact is: in the last five seasons, Brazil has won six titles in South America’s main international competitions. But what is the situation in Europe? <br/><br/> The following tables show the number of defeats of European clubs from the mentioned leagues by stage in the Champions League and Europa League over the last 5 seasons. <h3> <b>Champions League</b></h3> In the Champions League, France and Italy did not win titles, but had two runner-up finishes. What differentiates them from the winning leagues? France had the fewest teams reaching the round of 16 and fewer total participations, with only two teams making the semifinals: Lyon and PSG (twice). Italy had the most eliminations in the round of 16, with poor performance overall. Another interesting observation: Spain had a 100% success rate in finals, winning both in which they participated. England, however, had an extraordinary performance: two titles and two runner-up finishes, with one all-English final. In other words, they had the best performance, appearing in 3 out of 5 finals. <br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-09-22-post_analise_ligas/tabelachamp.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center>Image 5.

Once again, France had the fewest participations in the competition. Only three French teams made it past the group stage. Italy reached three finals but managed to win only one. Germany’s numbers are similar in both competitions, with nothing standing out. The biggest difference between the competitions is in England’s performance: in the Europa League, the English only reached one final and were runners-up. <br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-09-22-post_analise_ligas/tabelaeuro.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center>Image 6. Number of teams from each country by stage in the UEL in the last 5 years<br/><br/></center> <br/><br/> <h2> <b>Discussion</b> </h2> From the above analysis, we will combine all this information to try to answer the question from the introduction: "What is the best league in the world?" This question carries a degree of subjectivity, as it depends on what you want to observe in a league. <br/><br/> Looking at the most valuable league in the world, the choice would be the Premier League, with a value greater than 12 billion euros in the last season, which has been growing exponentially year after year. <br/><br/> In terms of Performance in Unequal Matches, the Brazilian league shows a low average PUM, indicating that lower market value teams can compete more equally and win more points against richer clubs. This results in more unpredictable championships and, consequently, more competitiveness. <br/><br/> When observing the performance of countries in international competitions, it becomes more subjective. In South America, Brazil is dominant, with 6 titles won in the last five years, 5 of them in the toughest competition in the Americas. In Europe, there is a greater variety of champions: only France failed to win a title. Spain won the most titles (5), and England ties with Spain in finals appearances (5 out of 10). <br/><br/> <h2> <b>Conclusion</b> </h2> Which is the best league in the world? It depends on the point of view. European leagues have a higher market value, meaning they have the best players and coaches, resulting in higher-quality matches. However, the unpredictability of the matches is lower and, in a way, less exciting. In the Brazilian league, we can see that the lower average PUM provides greater unpredictability, which brings excitement to the championship. This unpredictability is likely related to player quality, which affects the quality of the games. Therefore, answering the question about which league is the best depends on the fan’s perspective. <br/><br/> Thank you for reading and stay tuned for future posts! <br/><br/> <div> </div></div>]]></content><author><name>Ace Laboratory Football Team - Lucas Calmon, Pedro Carvalho</name></author><category term="Football;"/><category term="Analysis"/><category term="Football;"/><category term="Analysis"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">2023 Women’s World Cup - Analyzing the progress of the Brazilian national team</title><link href="https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2024/post_women_world_cup_4_en/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="2023 Women’s World Cup - Analyzing the progress of the Brazilian national team"/><published>2024-09-05T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2024/post_women_world_cup_4_en</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2024/post_women_world_cup_4_en/"><![CDATA[<hr/> <p align="justify"> Se quiser ler este texto em pt-br, <a href="https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2000/post_women_world_cup_4_pt/"> clique aqui. </a> </p> <div style="text-align: justify"> In this post, we're going to analyse the Brazilian national team's campaigns in the last two World Cups. The aim is to find out whether or not there has been any kind of evolution in the Brazilian team, and to understand what level the team was at in those competitions, both in the global and continental context. To do this, we're going to compare Brazil with the teams featured in the last post (Spain, the United States, Sweden and England) and with other South American teams (Argentina, Colombia in 2023, Chile in 2019).<br/><br/> <h2> <b>Overview</b> </h2> <h3> <b>2019 World Cup</b> </h3> At the 2019 World Cup, the Brazilian team was seeded in a group with Australia, Italy and Jamaica. Their performance in the group stage was good: 2 wins in 3 games, scoring 6 goals and conceding 3 during the first phase. Despite their good run, Brazil progressed to the knockout stage in third place after a triple draw in Group C (the place was won on the basis of the best third-placed team).<br/><br/> In the Round of 16, Brazil faced France in a very tight game. Despite a balance in possession during regulation time, the Brazilians had 12 shots, while the French had 5. The match was only decided in the second half of overtime, when France scored the winning goal and ended Brazil's participation in the competition.<br/><br/> <h3> <b>2023 World Cup</b> </h3> At the 2023 World Cup, Brazil had an even shorter and more frustrating campaign. Once again, the Brazilian team finished third, now in Group F, which included France, Jamaica and Panama. The Brazilians won one and drew one in three games, but in this edition, only the top two teams in the group qualified for the knockout stage.<br/><br/> When we say that the campaign was frustrating, it was not for nothing. On the final matchday of the group stage, Brazil only needed a simple win against Jamaica, an opponent who qualified with a single goal against Panama (who conceded 11 in the competition). In theory, qualification seemed on course. In practice, Brazil, despite a giant dominance when we analyse possession, the number of passes and shots, were unable to make satisfactory use of the many chances that were created. The result could not have been any other: 0-0, and the Brazilian team was eliminated in the first phase of the competition.<br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-09-05-post_women_world_cup_4/Shotmap.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h2> <b>Statistics between Cups</b> </h2> In this section, we're going to analyse Brazil's participation using different scatter plots. The idea is to be able to compare both the evolution (or regression) from one World Cup to the next, as well as a general comparison between the campaigns of other teams.<br/><br/> Before starting the analyses and comments section, we have to say that, because the World Cup is a short tournament (and, unfortunately, the Brazilian team's campaigns even shorter), some matches end up having a big impact on the metrics shown below. This context must be taken into account when analysing.<br/><br/> <h2> <b>Passes and Progression</b> </h2> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-09-05-post_women_world_cup_4/Passes.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> Analysing the passes and progression of the 2019 Brazilian team, you can see the low number of progressive passes per match, which is considerably below average. In 2019, the team made an average of approximately 40 progressive passes per match, about 20% less than the average of the other teams. Furthermore, there has been a noticeable improvement from the 2019 World Cup to the 2023 World Cup, with Brazil being one of the best teams in this regard.<br/><br/> - Brazil's opponents in South America are not well placed on the graph, either in relation to the main European teams or in relation to Brazil.<br/><br/> - In 2023, Brazil improved in both aspects, with around 30 progressive drives and almost 70 progressive passes per game, revealing a significant evolution, with the team assuming a more aggressive and progressive profile on the pitch compared to the much less offensive behaviour of the team in 2019. In the 2019 campaign, Brazil made approximately 20% fewer progressive passes than the average of the other teams.<br/><br/> <h2> <b>Shots and xG per shot</b> </h2> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-09-05-post_women_world_cup_4/Shots.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> To analyse the quality of the teams' shots, we'll use the graph of shots per match vs. xG per shot.<br/><br/> - Once again, Brazil are better placed than their South American opponents, indicating that there is a big advantage for the Brazilian national team on their continent.<br/><br/> - Despite a much higher number of shots per match in 2023, Brazil have not seen a considerable improvement in the quality of their chances (expected goals per shot). The lack of progress in this area was, as we said, a determining factor in Brazil's elimination in the group stage.<br/><br/> - As we've already mentioned, the fact that the World Cup is a short tournament means that some matches have a big impact on the statistics. In this graph, we have a clear example of this in the number of shots that the Brazilian national team produced. In the second round of the group stage, against Panama, Brazil shot 33 times, scoring 4 goals on the occasion. This number of shots is greater than the sum of the shots in the other two matches, showing that the match against Panama creates a false impression that the Brazilian team had the characteristic of shooting often, but that this was an isolated episode in the competition.<br/><br/> <h2> <b>Final considerations and conclusion</b></h2> The graphs show that Brazil have had considerably better campaigns than their rivals in South America, but their main opponents in Europe and North America (who have a much more established national women's football scene) still have a big advantage.<br/><br/> Even though the campaigns analysed were short and, in some ways, disappointing, Brazil made great progress after 2023. In 2024, the Brazilian team, now led by coach Arthur Elias, won the silver medal at the Olympic Games in Paris, revealing important new players to the team, such as goalkeeper Lorena and defender Tarciane.<br/><br/> And so ends our series of posts analysing the 2023 Women's World Cup.

Even with very short careers, Spain's Salma Paralluelo, 20, and Colombia's Linda Caicedo, 19, have already been nominated to be among the 10 best players in the world in 2023 (according to the Ballon d'Or awards). <br/><br/> <h3>Salma Paralluelo</h3> Considered the third best player in the world in the 23/24 season, Paralluelo is currently one of Barcelona's main offensive players, as well as being an almost absolute starter for the Spanish national team, even though she has only been playing for a short time. The young player is left-footed, and in the national team she usually plays as a center forward. <br/><br/> Paralluelo was decisive in winning the 2023 World Cup. As well as starting in all 7 games,<b> she scored two very important goals</b> for her team in the competition: a goal against the Netherlands in the quarter-finals and another against Sweden in the semi-finals. <br/><br/> Graph 1 shows all of Paralluelo's progressive actions during the competition. It can be seen that there is a high concentration of these actions on the left side of the pitch, with many carries directed towards the back line and many passes directed towards the center of the opponent's box. In the 7 games she played during the 2023 World Cup, Salma played as a right winger, as a left winger and, above all, as a center forward. Her position wasn't fixed during the competition, and this fluctuation allowed us to better visualize her playing preference, since even though she was in other positions, she was always more participative on the left. <br/><br/> <b>Definition of progressive action:</b> Actions in the first 30% of the pitch are ignored. They must reduce the distance from the ball to the opponent's goal by at least 15%.

Introduction In the second post of our series analyzing the 2023 Women's World Cup, we'll talk about two players who have shown enormous potential during the most important international competition. Even with very short careers, Spain's Salma Paralluelo, 20, and Colombia's Linda Caicedo, 19, have already been nominated to be among the 10 best players in the world in 2023 (according to the Ballon d'Or awards). Salma Paralluelo Considered the third best player in the world in the 23/24 season, Paralluelo is currently one of Barcelona's main offensive players, as well as being an almost absolute starter for the Spanish national team, even though she has only been playing for a short time. The young player is left-footed, and in the national team she usually plays as a center forward. Paralluelo was decisive in winning the 2023 World Cup. As well as starting in all 7 games, she scored two very important goals for her team in the competition: a goal against the Netherlands in the quarter-finals and another against Sweden in the semi-finals. Graph 1 shows all of Paralluelo's progressive actions during the competition. It can be seen that there is a high concentration of these actions on the left side of the pitch, with many carries directed towards the back line and many passes directed towards the center of the opponent's box. In the 7 games she played during the 2023 World Cup, Salma played as a right winger, as a left winger and, above all, as a center forward. Her position wasn't fixed during the competition, and this fluctuation allowed us to better visualize her playing preference, since even though she was in other positions, she was always more participative on the left. Definition of progressive action: Actions in the first 30% of the pitch are ignored. They must reduce the distance from the ball to the opponent's goal by at least 15%. Only successful passes or drives that are finished closer vertically to the opponent's goal or that have their end point inside the opponent's penalty area are counted. Graph 1. Salma Paralluelo’s Progressive Actions Something interesting to note is the high number of progressive carries, a common characteristic of fast players with good physical conditioning. Coincidence or not, Paralluelo practiced athletics (short- and middle-distance running) for many years, even going so far as to have to combine this activity with playing football at the club that revealed her, Villarreal. We also need to mention another important attribute of Paralluelo's for his team: her ability to pressurize the ball. As we mentioned in our last post, Spain's style of play is very aggressive. To put this into practice, their attacking players have to be involved even when the team is without the ball, and Paralluelo is one of the best examples to show how this happens, as she is the third Spanish player with the most defensive actions in the competition, with the vast majority of these actions being performed in the opponent's half. Graph 2. Salma Paralluelo’s Defensive Actions Linda Caicedo Linda was nominated as the ninth best player in the world in 2023 (by the Ballon d'Or awards).

In the national team, Linda is generally more of an offensive player, which makes it possible to think of her as a classic attacking midfielder. At the 2023 Women's World Cup, she was a starter in all five of Colombia's matches (eliminated in the quarter-finals), scoring two goals and providing one assist.

Compared to Paralluelo, we can see that even with an almost equal number of progressive actions per 90 minutes, Caicedo executes many more progressive passes/90 (Caicedo 3.75 vs. 3.27 Paralluelo), while the Spaniard uses a lot of carries to attempt to attack (Caicedo 5.06 vs. 5.64 Paralluelo). In all, Linda had 47 progressive actions during the competition, making her the third Colombian player with the most progressive actions per 90 minutes. Graph 3.

Despite this, we can say that Paralluelo is efficient when passing under pressure, a very important characteristic for any center forward. Graph 5. Comparative Radar between Paralluelo and Caicedo Conclusion After this analysis, we can get an idea of the characteristics and potential of these two young players, who should be even more important for their team and for the women's soccer scene at the 2027 World Cup, which will be hosted in Brazil. This was our second post analyzing the 2023 Women's World Cup. Our next post will focus on the most outstanding players in the competition, but without the emphasis on promising young players.

We'll provide general comparisons between all the teams, and then delve into the four semi-finalists and the highlights of the competition. <br/><br/> In this post, we'll talk about both the finalists of the 2023 Women's World Cup: Spain and England. <br/><br/> <h3>Tournament Overview</h3> Popularly known as a short tournament, since 7 is the maximum number of games a team can play, the World Cup is the biggest tournament in the world played by national teams. In 2023, Spain were crowned world champions in women's soccer against England, with a very young team, just like in men's soccer, with an average age of less than 26 in the starting line-up.<br/><br/> <h3>The final </h3> The final of the 2023 Women's World Cup was held on August 20 and featured England and Spain. The Spaniards came out on top, winning the game 1-0 with a goal from Olga Carmona in the 29th minute (it's worth noting that Spain had the chance to extend the lead with a missed penalty in the second half). The Spanish team played a strong and solid game, accumulating <b>more than 2 expected goals</b>, superiority in possession, and <b>3 great chances created</b> during the course of the match.<br/><br/> Despite a bitter fourth place in the previous World Cup, England were coming off the back of winning the Finalissima (a play-off between the winner of the EURO and the winner of the Copa America) over Brazil, as well as an excellent run so far in the 2023 World Cup. Even so, they were unable to impose their game on the Spain team. The English side accumulated less than <b>0.5</b> expected goals, as well as <b>only one great chance created</b>, showing that the <b>43% possession</b> did not convert into volume of play.<br/><br/> <h2> Analyzing the finalists </h2> In the graphs below, you can get a better idea of how the finalists played in the tournament. In the passing graph, it is noticeable that the English team <b>tends to pass a lot behind the midfield line</b>, with the defenders playing a significant role in a very withdrawn position. Spain's passing is<b> more concentrated in midfield, suggesting a more aggressive style of play</b> compared to their opponents in the last game. This analysis of the tournament is reflected in the final, as Spain, choosing to dictate the game more and exchanging more passes in areas closer to the opponent's goal, created most of the chances and accumulated a greater number of expected goals.<br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-08-01-post_women_world_cup_1/pass_heatmap_comparison.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center>Graph 1. Pass Heatmap (in all the competition)<br/><br/></center> In this second graph, we show in which areas of the pitch each team applies the most pressure to their opponents throughout the tournament. Again, the Spanish side's map suggests a <b>more aggressive style</b>, concentrating their pressing actions on the opponent's pitch. On the other hand, the England team<b> presses more evenly across the pitch</b>, with only one area of high concentration: the right side, near the halfway line.<br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-08-01-post_women_world_cup_1/pressure_heatmap_comparison.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center>Graph 2. Pressure Heatmap (in all the competition)<br/><br/></center> Apart from the tactical aspect, something very interesting to note is the average age of the Spanish team. Spain's starting line-up in the final had an <b>average age of 25.7</b>, one of the lowest in the entire competition and the lowest among the teams that played in the knockout stage. This suggests that Spain's reformulation, which was much talked about and praised recently during the men's Euro, is also (very positively) affecting the women's team. In the final, 6 of the 10 best players in the world (according to the Ballon d'Or awards) were on the pitch. Of these, 4 were Spanish players (two were under 25, and we'll talk more about one of them in a later post!). <br/><br/> In the next section, we'll use shot maps to analyze the attacking performance of the finalist teams during the competition. Spain's map shows their aggressive style, <b>being the team with the most goals and shots per game (22.1)</b> of all the teams in the competition. On the other hand, it's important to note the efficiency of England's shots, as they had a <b>positive balance of 3.18 in the difference between goals and xG</b>. In addition, it's worth noting that the England side shoot far less than their opponents in the final, with an average of <b>13.2 shots per game</b>.<br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-08-01-post_women_world_cup_1/spain_shot_map.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center>Graph 3.

England's Shot Map (in all the competition)<br/><br/></center> As is often the case in many important finals, <b>the teams had lower attacking numbers than "expected"</b> (based on their performance throughout the competition), since, given the importance of the match, the teams usually choose to play in a more studied and less risky way. Spain had <b>13</b> shots in the match, while England had <b>8</b>.<br/><br/> <h2>Conclusion</h2> During the analysis, we can see that there is a certain duality between the teams. Spain, being an example of a young and dynamic team, successfully imposed their style of play during the tournament, <b>being aggressive with and without the ball</b>. On the other side, England play in a <b>more methodical way</b>, not daring to use high blocks of pressure and constantly keeping possession with their defenders. Both ways of playing soccer were <b>examples of success</b> during the competition, but in the end the Spanish style prevailed. <br/><br/> Despite finishing second in the most important international competition, England are the current champions of the Women's EURO (having knocked out Spain themselves during the tournament). So everything indicates that the duel that decided the world title in 2023 will continue to be very relevant and fierce in the future. <br/><br/> That was our first post analyzing the 2023 Women's World Cup. <b>Our next post will focus on the young players who stood out in the tournament</b> and are expected to be even more prominent in the 2027 World Cup, which will be hosted in Brazil. <br/><br/> <div> </div></div>]]></content><author><name>Ace Laboratory Football Team - Daniel Barros, Hugo Antunes</name></author><category term="Football;"/><category term="Analysis"/><category term="Football;"/><category term="Analysis;"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Se quiser ler este texto em pt-br, clique aqui.

This tool is engineered to provide personalized itineraries that cater to individual preferences, using advanced algorithms to help attendees fully engage with the events, attractions, and venues. In this post, we will explore the methodologies and technologies behind the development of the Olympics Planner 2024.<br/><br/> </p> <h2 id="data-collection">Data Collection</h2> <p align="justify"> We sourced our dataset from the official publications of<a href="https://tickets.paris2024.org/en/"> the Paris Olympic Committee</a>, which provided details about event schedules, ticket pricing, and venue information. We gathered data on event timings, costs of tickets, and the exact locations of venues, documented with both addresses and geographic coordinates.<br/><br/> Scripts were crafted to extract this information from the official Olympic website, a process that presented challenges due to the complex presentation of the site's data and issues with data accessibility. These obstacles underscore the complexities of employing this methodology with historical Olympic data, which may be even harder to access.<br/><br/> Additionally, we incorporated financial considerations into our model by including both the average travel costs between events and the ticket prices. To ensure total expenses remained within the allocated budget, we introduced a budget constraint. Travel costs were estimated by calculating the travel time between venues and multiplying it by the average cost per minute, providing a more realistic assessment of the financial implications of attending multiple events. </p> <h2 id="the-model">The Model</h2> <p align="justify"> We approached the task of crafting optimal viewing schedules for the Olympic Games by formulating it as a network flow optimization model. Our goal was to develop personalized schedules that prioritized spectator preferences while ensuring the feasibility of travel and maintaining a coherent schedule. <br/><br/> Consider a directed graph \( G = (V, A) \), where \( V \) represents the set of vertices denoting Olympic events, and \( A \) represents the arcs denoting transitions between events.<br/><br/> Each event \( i \in V \) is defined by its start time \( t^{\text{start}}_i \) and duration \( \text{duration}_i \), where \( t^{\text{end}}_i = t^{\text{start}}_i + \text{duration}_i \). The start time \( t^{\text{start}}_i \) denotes the minute within the total Olympic timeline when event \( i \) begins.<br/><br/> Each event \( i \in V \) has an associated ticket price \( c_i \). Additionally, there is an average travel cost per minute \( c_{ij} \) for each arc \( (i, j) \in A \). The total travel cost between events \( i \) and \( j \) is given by \( c_{ij} \times t_{ij} \), where \( t_{ij} \) represents the travel time in minutes between the two events. Spectators have a maximum budget \( B \), which serves as an upper limit on total costs, covering both ticket prices and travel expenses.<br/><br/> In addition to costs, each event \( i \in V \) is assigned a preference score \( p_i \), reflecting spectator interest in attending that event.<br/><br/> Let \( x_{ij} \) be a binary decision variable for arc \( (i, j) \in A \), where \( x_{ij} = 1 \) indicates a spectator travels from event \( i \) to event \( j \), and \( x_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. Similarly, let \( w_i \) be a binary decision variable for vertex \( i \in V \), where \( w_i = 1 \) indicates attendance at event \( i \), and \( w_i = 0 \) otherwise.<br/><br/> The optimization problem is formulated as follows: $$ \begin{align} \text{Maximize} \quad &amp; Z = \sum_{i \in V} p_i w_i \label{eq:objective}\\ \text{subject to} \\ &amp; \sum_{j \in V \setminus \{i\}} x_{ij} = w_i, \quad \forall i \in V \setminus \{n+1\} \label{eq:sequence_1}\\ &amp; \sum_{i \in V \setminus \{j\}} x_{ij} = w_j, \quad \forall j \in V \setminus \{0\} \label{eq:sequence_2}\\ &amp; \sum_{i \in V} x_{0i} = 1 \label{eq:start}\\ &amp; \sum_{i \in V} x_{i(n+1)} = 1 \label{eq:end}\\ &amp; t^{\text{end}}i + t{ij} - M_{ij}(1 - x_{ij}) \leq t^{\text{start}}_j, \quad \forall i, j \in V, i \neq j \label{eq:travel_time}\\ &amp; \sum_{i \in V} c_i w_i + \sum_{j \in V} x_{ij}c_{ij}t_{ij} \leq B \label{eq:budget}\\ &amp; x_{ij} \in \{0, 1\}, \quad \forall (i, j) \in A \label{eq:binary_x}\\ &amp; w_i \in \{0, 1\}, \quad \forall i \in V \label{eq:binary_y} \end{align} $$ <p align="justify"> where, <br/><br/> </p> $$ \begin{align} M_{ij} = \max\{0, t^{\text{end}}i + t{ij} - t^{\text{start}}_j\} \end{align} $$ The objective function \( Z \) aims to maximize the total preference score, thereby prioritizing events that spectators are highly interested in attending. Constraints ensure logical sequencing of events (\( \ref{eq:sequence_1} \) and \( \ref{eq:sequence_2} \)), define the start (\( \ref{eq:start} \)) and end (\( \ref{eq:end} \)) of the viewing schedule, enforce feasible travel times (\( \ref{eq:travel_time} \)), and maintain budget constraints (\( \ref{eq:budget} \)). Variables \( x_{ij} \) and \( w_i \) are binary, ensuring the model's feasibility and practical application. </p> <p align="justify"> The model's implementation consisted of three key steps: constructing a directed graph, calculating travel times, and assigning preference scores and costs to each event.<br/><br/> Preference scores were allocated to each event based on spectator interest, categorized into five levels ranging from "Very Uninterested" to "Very Interested," each assigned a specific weight. Additionally, the cost of attending each event was incorporated into the model by including ticket prices. Travel times between venues for spectators attending in person were determined using Geographic Information System (GIS) tools. These tools accounted for actual travel routes and car travel durations to ensure feasible transitions between events within the planned schedule.<br/><br/> </p> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-07-15-olympics-planner/routejpg.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p align="justify"> This research introduces a novel approach to optimizing Olympic Game-Watching Schedules using network flow optimization.
