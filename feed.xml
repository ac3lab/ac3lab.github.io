The teams analyzed will be: <b>Spain</b>, the current champions; <b>England</b>, the current vice-champions; the <b>United States</b>, champions in 2019 and <b>Sweden</b>, who finished third in the last two editions. <br/><br/> <h2> <b>Retrospect</b> </h2> <h3> <b>Spain</b> </h3> After winning the 2023 World Cup, Spain have established themselves as one of the<b> best teams in international football</b>. With an excellent campaign in the last edition, they won the title in a final against England (these two teams were the subject of the <a href="https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2024/post_women_world_cup_1_en/"> first post of our series</a>). <br/><br/> In 2019, though, Spain's situation was very different. <b>With fewer established players and without several of the young players who made a difference in 2023</b>, such as Salma Paralluelo, Spain got through the group stage via goal difference, with a below-average campaign (1W, 1D, 1L). In the round of 16, <b>they were eliminated by the United States</b>, winners of that edition. <br/><br/> <h3> <b>England</b> </h3> <b>England have performed well in the last two World Cups</b>. In 2019, they finished in fourth place, losing to Sweden after losing in the semi-finals to the United States, who won that edition. In addition, as we mentioned, England are the current vice-champions of the world, defeated in the final by Spain. <br/><br/> In 2019, despite falling into a tough group with Japan, Argentina and Scotland, they didn't face much difficulty and came out on top with 3 wins in 3 games. In the knockout stage, they were only defeated in the semi-finals 2-1 in a match against the United States. <br/><br/> <h3> <b>United States</b> </h3> At the 2019 World Cup, <b>the United States won their fourth world title</b> (they also won 1991, 1999 and 2015), their second in a row, in a final against Netherlands. In this edition, the US broke a record that still stands today: <b>the team with the most goals in a World Cup (26!)</b>. <br/><br/> However, at the 2023 World Cup, the United States were eliminated in the round of 16 in a penalty shootout against Sweden. This campaign can be considered frustrating and was marked by a big decline in the performance of the United States attack (we'll see why in the following analysis). <br/><br/> <h3> <b>Sweden</b> </h3> <b>Sweden has done well in recent World Cups</b>. In 2019, they won third place, having eliminated strong teams like <b>Germany</b> and <b>Argentina</b> in the knockout stage. In this edition, Sweden only lost to the two finalists: the United States (in the group stage) and the Netherlands (in the semi-final). <br/><br/> In 2023, Sweden repeated their 2019 campaign and managed to win third place again. This time, they only lost one match (against champion Spain in the semi-final) out of the seven they played. In the match for third place, Sweden beat Australia 2-0. <br/><br/> <h2> <b>Comparison of World Cup campaigns</b> </h2> In this section, we will analyze the teams using different scatter graphs. The idea is to be able to compare both the evolution (or decline) of a team from one Cup to the next, as well as a general comparison between all the campaigns of the teams mentioned so far. <br/><br/> <h3> <b>Passes and Progression</b> </h3> First, it's important to mention that we've updated our definition of progressive action compared to the last post. <br/><br/> <b>Definition of progressive passing:</b> Actions in the first 30% of the pitch are ignored.

Even with very short careers, Spain's Salma Paralluelo, 20, and Colombia's Linda Caicedo, 19, have already been nominated to be among the 10 best players in the world in 2023 (according to the Ballon d'Or awards). <br/><br/> <h3>Salma Paralluelo</h3> Considered the third best player in the world in the 23/24 season, Paralluelo is currently one of Barcelona's main offensive players, as well as being an almost absolute starter for the Spanish national team, even though she has only been playing for a short time. The young player is left-footed, and in the national team she usually plays as a center forward. <br/><br/> Paralluelo was decisive in winning the 2023 World Cup. As well as starting in all 7 games,<b> she scored two very important goals</b> for her team in the competition: a goal against the Netherlands in the quarter-finals and another against Sweden in the semi-finals. <br/><br/> Graph 1 shows all of Paralluelo's progressive actions during the competition. It can be seen that there is a high concentration of these actions on the left side of the pitch, with many carries directed towards the back line and many passes directed towards the center of the opponent's box. In the 7 games she played during the 2023 World Cup, Salma played as a right winger, as a left winger and, above all, as a center forward. Her position wasn't fixed during the competition, and this fluctuation allowed us to better visualize her playing preference, since even though she was in other positions, she was always more participative on the left. <br/><br/> <b>Definition of progressive action:</b> Actions in the first 30% of the pitch are ignored. They must reduce the distance from the ball to the opponent's goal by at least 15%. Only successful passes or drives that are finished closer vertically to the opponent's goal or that have their end point inside the opponent's penalty area are counted. <br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-08-09-post_women_world_cup_2/paralluelo_progressive_actions.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center>Graph 1.

Coincidence or not, <b>Paralluelo practiced athletics</b> (short- and middle-distance running) for many years, even going so far as to have to combine this activity with playing football at the club that revealed her, Villarreal. <br/><br/> We also need to mention another important attribute of Paralluelo's for his team: her <b>ability to pressurize the ball</b>. As we mentioned in our last post, Spain's style of play is very aggressive. To put this into practice, their attacking players have to be involved even when the team is without the ball, and Paralluelo is one of the best examples to show how this happens, as she is the <b>third Spanish player with the most defensive actions in the competition</b>, with the vast majority of these actions being performed in the opponent's half. <br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-08-09-post_women_world_cup_2/paralluelo_defensive_actions.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center> Graph 2. Salma Paralluelo’s Defensive Actions<br/><br/></center> <h3> Linda Caicedo </h3> Linda was nominated as the ninth best player in the world in 2023 (by the Ballon d'Or awards). She is currently a midfielder for Real Madrid and the Colombian national team, and a first team regular for both. In the national team, Linda is generally more of an offensive player, which makes it possible to think of her as a <b>classic attacking midfielder</b>. At the 2023 Women's World Cup, she was a starter in all five of Colombia's matches (eliminated in the quarter-finals), <b>scoring two goals and providing one assist</b>. <br/><br/> In the map of progressive actions, we can see a large <b>flow of actions that start on the left and end up in the center or on the right of the field</b>. Compared to Paralluelo, we can see that even with an almost equal number of progressive actions per 90 minutes, <b>Caicedo executes many more progressive passes/90</b> (Caicedo 3.75 vs. 3.27 Paralluelo), while the Spaniard uses a lot of carries to attempt to attack (Caicedo 5.06 vs. 5.64 Paralluelo). <br/><br/> In all, Linda had 47 progressive actions during the competition, making her the <b>third Colombian player with the most progressive actions per 90 minutes</b>. <br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-08-09-post_women_world_cup_2/caicedo_progressive_actions.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center> Graph 3.

Looking at xG and goals, <b>Linda's incredible efficiency stands out</b>, as she has accumulated over 0.37 goals with around 0.06 expected goals. <b>Salma has a very intense contribution in shots</b>, finishing almost 3 times every 90 minutes, while Linda articulates the game considerably more with passes, executing almost 30 passes per match. <br/><br/> In addition, there is a considerable discrepancy in passing accuracy between the two players, with Linda Caicedo having a good advantage. However, this can be explained by the difference in the positions and roles played by the two players. As she played most of her minutes as a center forward at the World Cup, Paralluelo was often faced with a context in which <b>passes are more difficult and more susceptible to error</b>, as she is marked more intensely than players who play in Linda's position. Despite this, we can say that <b>Paralluelo is efficient when passing under pressure</b>, a very important characteristic for any center forward. <br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-08-09-post_women_world_cup_2/comparative_radar.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center>Graph 5.

As she played most of her minutes as a center forward at the World Cup, Paralluelo was often faced with a context in which passes are more difficult and more susceptible to error, as she is marked more intensely than players who play in Linda's position. Despite this, we can say that Paralluelo is efficient when passing under pressure, a very important characteristic for any center forward. Graph 5. Comparative Radar between Paralluelo and Caicedo Conclusion After this analysis, we can get an idea of the characteristics and potential of these two young players, who should be even more important for their team and for the women's soccer scene at the 2027 World Cup, which will be hosted in Brazil. This was our second post analyzing the 2023 Women's World Cup. Our next post will focus on the most outstanding players in the competition, but without the emphasis on promising young players.

In 2023, Spain were crowned world champions in women's soccer against England, with a very young team, just like in men's soccer, with an average age of less than 26 in the starting line-up.<br/><br/> <h3>The final </h3> The final of the 2023 Women's World Cup was held on August 20 and featured England and Spain. The Spaniards came out on top, winning the game 1-0 with a goal from Olga Carmona in the 29th minute (it's worth noting that Spain had the chance to extend the lead with a missed penalty in the second half). The Spanish team played a strong and solid game, accumulating <b>more than 2 expected goals</b>, superiority in possession, and <b>3 great chances created</b> during the course of the match.<br/><br/> Despite a bitter fourth place in the previous World Cup, England were coming off the back of winning the Finalissima (a play-off between the winner of the EURO and the winner of the Copa America) over Brazil, as well as an excellent run so far in the 2023 World Cup. Even so, they were unable to impose their game on the Spain team. The English side accumulated less than <b>0.5</b> expected goals, as well as <b>only one great chance created</b>, showing that the <b>43% possession</b> did not convert into volume of play.<br/><br/> <h2> Analyzing the finalists </h2> In the graphs below, you can get a better idea of how the finalists played in the tournament. In the passing graph, it is noticeable that the English team <b>tends to pass a lot behind the midfield line</b>, with the defenders playing a significant role in a very withdrawn position. Spain's passing is<b> more concentrated in midfield, suggesting a more aggressive style of play</b> compared to their opponents in the last game. This analysis of the tournament is reflected in the final, as Spain, choosing to dictate the game more and exchanging more passes in areas closer to the opponent's goal, created most of the chances and accumulated a greater number of expected goals.<br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-08-01-post_women_world_cup_1/pass_heatmap_comparison.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center>Graph 1.

This suggests that Spain's reformulation, which was much talked about and praised recently during the men's Euro, is also (very positively) affecting the women's team. In the final, 6 of the 10 best players in the world (according to the Ballon d'Or awards) were on the pitch.

This tool is engineered to provide personalized itineraries that cater to individual preferences, using advanced algorithms to help attendees fully engage with the events, attractions, and venues. In this post, we will explore the methodologies and technologies behind the development of the Olympics Planner 2024.<br/><br/> </p> <h2 id="data-collection">Data Collection</h2> <p align="justify"> We sourced our dataset from the official publications of<a href="https://tickets.paris2024.org/en/"> the Paris Olympic Committee</a>, which provided details about event schedules, ticket pricing, and venue information. We gathered data on event timings, costs of tickets, and the exact locations of venues, documented with both addresses and geographic coordinates.<br/><br/> Scripts were crafted to extract this information from the official Olympic website, a process that presented challenges due to the complex presentation of the site's data and issues with data accessibility. These obstacles underscore the complexities of employing this methodology with historical Olympic data, which may be even harder to access.<br/><br/> Additionally, we incorporated financial considerations into our model by including both the average travel costs between events and the ticket prices. To ensure total expenses remained within the allocated budget, we introduced a budget constraint. Travel costs were estimated by calculating the travel time between venues and multiplying it by the average cost per minute, providing a more realistic assessment of the financial implications of attending multiple events. </p> <h2 id="the-model">The Model</h2> <p align="justify"> We approached the task of crafting optimal viewing schedules for the Olympic Games by formulating it as a network flow optimization model. Our goal was to develop personalized schedules that prioritized spectator preferences while ensuring the feasibility of travel and maintaining a coherent schedule. <br/><br/> Consider a directed graph \( G = (V, A) \), where \( V \) represents the set of vertices denoting Olympic events, and \( A \) represents the arcs denoting transitions between events.<br/><br/> Each event \( i \in V \) is defined by its start time \( t^{\text{start}}_i \) and duration \( \text{duration}_i \), where \( t^{\text{end}}_i = t^{\text{start}}_i + \text{duration}_i \). The start time \( t^{\text{start}}_i \) denotes the minute within the total Olympic timeline when event \( i \) begins.<br/><br/> Each event \( i \in V \) has an associated ticket price \( c_i \). Additionally, there is an average travel cost per minute \( c_{ij} \) for each arc \( (i, j) \in A \). The total travel cost between events \( i \) and \( j \) is given by \( c_{ij} \times t_{ij} \), where \( t_{ij} \) represents the travel time in minutes between the two events. Spectators have a maximum budget \( B \), which serves as an upper limit on total costs, covering both ticket prices and travel expenses.<br/><br/> In addition to costs, each event \( i \in V \) is assigned a preference score \( p_i \), reflecting spectator interest in attending that event.<br/><br/> Let \( x_{ij} \) be a binary decision variable for arc \( (i, j) \in A \), where \( x_{ij} = 1 \) indicates a spectator travels from event \( i \) to event \( j \), and \( x_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. Similarly, let \( w_i \) be a binary decision variable for vertex \( i \in V \), where \( w_i = 1 \) indicates attendance at event \( i \), and \( w_i = 0 \) otherwise.<br/><br/> The optimization problem is formulated as follows: $$ \begin{align} \text{Maximize} \quad &amp; Z = \sum_{i \in V} p_i w_i \label{eq:objective}\\ \text{subject to} \\ &amp; \sum_{j \in V \setminus \{i\}} x_{ij} = w_i, \quad \forall i \in V \setminus \{n+1\} \label{eq:sequence_1}\\ &amp; \sum_{i \in V \setminus \{j\}} x_{ij} = w_j, \quad \forall j \in V \setminus \{0\} \label{eq:sequence_2}\\ &amp; \sum_{i \in V} x_{0i} = 1 \label{eq:start}\\ &amp; \sum_{i \in V} x_{i(n+1)} = 1 \label{eq:end}\\ &amp; t^{\text{end}}i + t{ij} - M_{ij}(1 - x_{ij}) \leq t^{\text{start}}_j, \quad \forall i, j \in V, i \neq j \label{eq:travel_time}\\ &amp; \sum_{i \in V} c_i w_i + \sum_{j \in V} x_{ij}c_{ij}t_{ij} \leq B \label{eq:budget}\\ &amp; x_{ij} \in \{0, 1\}, \quad \forall (i, j) \in A \label{eq:binary_x}\\ &amp; w_i \in \{0, 1\}, \quad \forall i \in V \label{eq:binary_y} \end{align} $$ <p align="justify"> where, <br/><br/> </p> $$ \begin{align} M_{ij} = \max\{0, t^{\text{end}}i + t{ij} - t^{\text{start}}_j\} \end{align} $$ The objective function \( Z \) aims to maximize the total preference score, thereby prioritizing events that spectators are highly interested in attending. Constraints ensure logical sequencing of events (\( \ref{eq:sequence_1} \) and \( \ref{eq:sequence_2} \)), define the start (\( \ref{eq:start} \)) and end (\( \ref{eq:end} \)) of the viewing schedule, enforce feasible travel times (\( \ref{eq:travel_time} \)), and maintain budget constraints (\( \ref{eq:budget} \)). Variables \( x_{ij} \) and \( w_i \) are binary, ensuring the model's feasibility and practical application. </p> <p align="justify"> The model's implementation consisted of three key steps: constructing a directed graph, calculating travel times, and assigning preference scores and costs to each event.<br/><br/> Preference scores were allocated to each event based on spectator interest, categorized into five levels ranging from "Very Uninterested" to "Very Interested," each assigned a specific weight. Additionally, the cost of attending each event was incorporated into the model by including ticket prices. Travel times between venues for spectators attending in person were determined using Geographic Information System (GIS) tools. These tools accounted for actual travel routes and car travel durations to ensure feasible transitions between events within the planned schedule.<br/><br/> </p> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-07-15-olympics-planner/routejpg.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p align="justify"> This research introduces a novel approach to optimizing Olympic Game-Watching Schedules using network flow optimization. Set within a directed graph, the model seamlessly integrates spectator preferences, travel logistics, and budget considerations to craft personalized viewing schedules that enhance the overall experience.

The coach manages to get the most out of his players, and in the 23/24 season, almost all of them can be considered individual highlights in their respective roles. <br/><br/> In this post, we'll talk about the most important players for the Bundesliga champion's functioning. <br/><br/> <h3>The wingbacks, Grimaldo and Frimpong:</h3> One of the most interesting and unique features of this team is the presence of two extremely attacking wing-backs, who play a big part in the build-up play and are often in the final third of the pitch to complete plays. <br/><br/> The man in charge on the left side of the pitch is <b>Alejandro Grimaldo</b>. The 28-year-old Spaniard was bought from Benfica this season and has quickly become a key part of Xabi's style of play, and can even be considered, alongside Florian Wirtz, <b>the most important player in the team</b>. As well as being an excellent passer and playmaker, Grimaldo has two other attributes worth mentioning: his long-range shot and his free-kick. This season alone, the Spaniard <b>has scored 3 goals from outside the box, 2 of them from free-kicks</b>. <br/><br/> After such impressive performances during the season, Grimaldo was called up to play for his national team for the first time. <br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-05-27-post_leverkusen_3/Alejandro_Grimaldo.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> In the Bundesliga, Grimaldo was <b>the 6th player with the most goals scored</b>, but above him, there are only the center forwards, such as Bayern Munich's Harry Kane and RB Leipzig's Loïs Openda. The Bayer Leverkusen wingback was also the competition's <b>leader in assists</b> and <b>second in chances created</b>. <br/><br/> On the right wingback is Dutchman <b>Jeremie Frimpong</b>. The 23-year-old was signed from Bayer Leverkusen in the 20/21 season, but only established himself as a first-team regular the following season. Since then, it's been possible to see a big improvement in Frimpong's performance, which has become even clearer with the arrival of Xabi Alonso at the helm. <br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-05-27-post_leverkusen_3/Jeremie_Frimpong.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> The evolution in performance is clearly linked to <b>the change in the player's role, which became more attacking</b> with the arrival of the Spanish coach. We can see that, comparing Frimpong's first season as a starter at Leverkusen (the only one managed entirely by Gerardo Seoane) and the following two seasons, <b>the Dutchman's number of goal-scoring involvements has doubled.</b> <br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-05-27-post_leverkusen_3/FrimpogGA.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> It's important to note that Seoane was in charge of Leverkusen until the 8th round of the 22/23 Bundesliga season. In those 8 games, Frimpong scored two goals (an average of 0.25 goals per game). From matchday 9 onwards, with Xabi Alonso taking over as coach, Frimpong's number of goals per game rose to 0.5, showing that the period with the new coach had a much greater impact on his total number of goals and assists that season.<br/><br/> Looking at Frimpong's numbers pre-Xabi and post-Xabi, it's clear how much <b>the coach was a determining factor in the development of the Dutchman's offensive potential</b>. To show this more clearly, we looked at the heatmaps of all Frimpong's games from the 21/22 season to the current one, and grouped them into time intervals with data from 7 to 9 different games. In this way, we can better visualize the process of the Dutchman moving away from the defensive sector and towards the offensive sector, especially after Xabi Alonso's debut as coach on October 8, 2022. It's interesting to see, in the 23/24 season, <b>an intense occupation of the right side of the opponent's penalty area</b>. <br/><br/> <figure> <video src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-05-27-post_leverkusen_3/gif_frimpong_time_final.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" autoplay="" controls=""/> </figure> Analyzing the statistics of these two players in the Bundesliga made it even clearer what we meant when we said that this team is marked by its extremely attacking wingbacks. <br/><br/> <h3>The midfielder, Xhaka:</h3> The silent highlights of Xabi Alonso's team are in the more defensive part of midfield. In this area of the pitch, there are players who, despite their great importance to the team's functioning, are little remembered because they don't have inflated offensive numbers. <br/><br/> In one of the positions, there is a kind of relay, as on several occasions Argentinian Exequiel Palacios gives way to German Robert Andrich and, more often than not, the two perform very well. <br/><br/> On the other hand, one midfielder is unquestionable in the line-up. Swiss midfielder <b>Granit Xhaka</b> has made 32 Bundesliga appearances as a starter (33 including the one game he came on from the bench), and averages 86 minutes per game, showing that on the rare occasions he is substituted, it is only at the end of matches. As a result, Xhaka is Bayer Leverkusen's <b>second most-used player in the Bundesliga</b>, only behind goalkeeper Lukáš Hrádecký. <br/><br/> As well as his regularity in terms of playing time, it's important to highlight the player's incredible regularity in passing. Xhaka is the Bundesliga's <b>leader in accurate passes</b>, and has made an impressive 15 appearances with more than 100 passes and 90% accuracy. <br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-05-27-post_leverkusen_3/Granit_Xhaka.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> Next, we'll show the “sonar map” of Granit Xhaka's passes. The graph was created using data on the player's position, final position and the distance of the pass. From this, we were able to find out at which angle each pass comes from and, assuming 0º as the direction of the opponent's goal, group the passes by these angles. The number above each bar corresponds to the number of passes that occurred in that direction.<br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-05-27-post_leverkusen_3/sonar_map.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h3>The star, Florian Wirtz:</h3> You can't talk about Bayer Leverkusen without mentioning <b>Florian Wirtz</b>. Alongside Grimaldo, the 20-year-old German is considered the team's main player. The young attacking midfielder is almost impeccable in all offensive aspects: finishing, passing, dribbling, game vision, high pressing, etc. <br/><br/> Since his arrival at Bayer Leverkusen in 2020, Wirtz has been considered <b>one of the great promises of German soccer</b>, and every season he shows more of his potential. But, like many others in this team, it was Xabi Alonso who was responsible for getting the most out of Wirtz, who is having his best season in 23/24. <br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-05-27-post_leverkusen_3/Florian_Wirtz.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> Looking at the league as a whole, Wirtz is a standout in several statistics. The German is <b>8th in the ranking of goals scored</b> (behind only center forwards, except for teammate Alejandro Grimaldo) and <b>4th in right dribbles per game</b>. <br/><br/> <h3>The striker, Boniface:</h3> Finally, let's talk about the team's center forward: 23-year-old Nigerian <b>Victor Okoh Boniface</b>. Unfortunately, Boniface was out from round 17 to round 27 due to a serious injury he suffered in January. Despite this factor reducing the sample size, it is important to talk about the striker, as he is essential to the model of play that has enchanted Europe since the start of the season. <br/><br/> Even though he is now seen as fundamental, Boniface's arrival at Leverkusen for 20 million euros seemed a risk, given that he came from the Belgian league and that, despite having had a good season, he wasn't that impressive. Fortunately for Xabi Alonso, the price quickly became too small for the excellent player he received. The Bayer Leverkusen striker's speed, physical strength, understanding of the game and repertoire have even led to him being <b>called up to the Nigerian national team for the first time</b>. <br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-05-27-post_leverkusen_3/Victor_Boniface.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> It's also important to note <b>the difference felt by Bayer Leverkusen in the period without Boniface</b>. In the table below, we show the difference in the team's average goals per game in two different time intervals: the first 16 rounds, with Boniface available, and between rounds 17 and 27 (while Boniface was injured). We chose not to include the end of the championship in the comparison since, even if the player was available, his average minutes were much lower, a factor related to the period of greater caution with the player's health after injury. <br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-05-27-post_leverkusen_3/BonifaceGoals.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> Despite almost 3 months out of the league, Boniface was <b>the 7th player with the most goal participations in Bundesliga 23/24</b>. <br/><br/> <h2>Conclusion</h2> In the last post in our series on Bayer Leverkusen, we analyzed the data relating to some of the most important players in the undefeated Bundesliga champions. The intention was to show the impact that the young but already winning coach Xabi Alonso has had on his players, especially during this very special season for the squad. It's safe to say that the Spaniard has been responsible for “revealing” several of the team's players to the world, including getting several of them, like Grimaldo and Boniface, called up to their national teams for the first time. We can also say that the world is looking forward to seeing more of Bayer Leverkusen next season, which will put the club to the test in the Champions League and in the defense of the national title. </div>]]></content><author><name>Ace Laboratory Football Team - Daniel Barros</name></author><category term="Football;"/><category term="Analysis"/><category term="Football;"/><category term="Bundesliga;"/><category term="Analysis"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">In-Depth Analysis of Bayer Leverkusen - Past Seasons and Current Campaign</title><link href="https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2024/post_leverkusen_2_en/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="In-Depth Analysis of Bayer Leverkusen - Past Seasons and Current Campaign"/><published>2024-05-23T10:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-23T10:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2024/post_leverkusen_2_en</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2024/post_leverkusen_2_en/"><![CDATA[<hr/> <p align="justify"> Se quiser ler este texto em pt-br, <a href="https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2000/post_leverkusen_2_pt/"> clique aqui.</a> </p> <h2>Introduction</h2> <div style="text-align: justify"> Many aspects of Leverkusen have changed under Xabi Alonso. Some of the main changes have been the players and the way the squad has been managed. Therefore, in order to understand the success Leverkusen have enjoyed this season, it's important to analyze what happened to the squad before and after Xabi Alonso's arrival.<br/><br/> <h2>Players in the Squad</h2> One of the main changes made after the arrival of Xabi Alonso was the management of the players in the squad. To make this clearer, we analyze the players in the team over the last 3 seasons.<br/><br/> <h3>Season 2021/2022</h3> In 21/22, the team had a vast squad, with a total of 35 players and an average age of close to 24.5 years. In addition, the average value per player was around 13 million euros. In that season, the most estimated sector of the field on the market was the attack, with a value of approximately 170.70 million euros.<br/><br/> In 2021, Leverkusen hired a new coach, Swiss Gerardo Seone, who played his first game on August 7, 2021. Under the Swiss, Leverkusen played mostly in a 4-2-3-1 formation, very different from what happens today with Xabi Alonso. It's worth remembering that <a href="https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2024/post_leverkusen_1_en/"> Xabi's style of play</a> has already been discussed here on our blog!<br/><br/> It was in the 2021 season that the current seventh most valuable player in the world gained more prominence, being a player used frequently by Gerardo. In addition to the Leverkusen revelation, other players began to gain more prominence in the team too, such as striker Shick, who was the team's top scorer that season.<br/><br/> <h3>Season 2022/2023</h3> In 22/23, the squad didn't change much; it remained substantially the same as in 21/22. However, it was during this season that Xabi Alonso took over the team. To be more precise, Xabi took charge of Leverkusen on matchday 9 of the Bundesliga and matchday 4 of the Champions League.<br/><br/> Despite the few changes to the squad in general, Leverkusen sold some defenders and signed more midfielders. As a result, the most valued sector in 2022 was the midfield, which was valued at more than 185 million euros at the time.<br/><br/> After these small changes, the squad still had 35 players in it, the same number as in the 21/22 season, with the average age dropping slightly to 24.2 years. The average value of each player remained similar compared to 21/22.<br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-05-23-post_leverkusen_2/player_squad.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h3>Season 2023/2024 (current season)</h3> After the end of Xabi's first season at Leverkusen, the coach appeared to have more autonomy in assembling the squad for 23/24. The number of players has dropped considerably compared to previous years, and Leverkusen now have just 27 players, a reduction of 22%. At the moment, Leverkusen's average age is 24.8 and the average value of each player is 22 million euros. In other words, the average age has changed very little, but the value per player has increased by almost 70% compared to the 22/23 season.<br/><br/> However, even with the considerable reduction in the squad, Leverkusen have moved much more on the market than in recent seasons. In addition, the total value of the current squad has increased by 31% compared to last season. It is therefore essential to analyze Leverkusen's signings this season and how the players have increased in value since Xabi Alonso's arrival.<br/><br/> <h2>Hiring</h2> The main signings made after the arrival of Xabi Alonso were the transfer of midfielder Xhaka, who played for Arsenal, for 25 million euros; the arrival of striker Boniface, who played for Union Saint-Gilloise in Belgium; the transfer of winger Grimaldo, who played for Benfica, who arrived for free; and the arrival of goalkeeper Kovar, who was at Manchester United, who cost around 5 million euros. The one-off signings were extremely important for the Leverkusen team, with the five main players in the German team being Wirtz, Palacios, Xhaka, Grimaldo, Kovar, and Boniface.<br/><br/> Despite the signings, the players who were already at the club have improved incredibly. To analyze the growth of players, their market value is a very interesting parameter. In the graph below, you can see the players who have risen the most in value since Xabi Alonso's arrival. It's important to note that Boniface, acquired this season by Leverkusen, already has a market value almost double what he was paid. Boniface and Grimaldo, the latter of whom was acquired for free, show how well the signings have been executed, making the most of the opportunities on the market.<br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-05-23-post_leverkusen_2/player_market.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> In terms of player valuations alone, the balance was positive and exceeded 90 million euros. The estimated value of the total squad is almost 595 million euros, of which only 80 million were invested this year. It's worth remembering that in 2023 many players were sold, loaned, or released by Leverkusen, and the devaluation of the squad due to these losses totals 119 million. As such, in addition to the amount invested, Xabi Alonso's work has been fundamental in valuing the players. Xabi qualified the players already in the squad, and Leverkusen took advantage of the opportunities of a very competitive market.<br/><br/> <h2>Team Performance</h2> Finally, it's interesting to compare the development of the team over the three seasons mentioned above. In 2021/2022 before Xabi Alonso, in 2022/2023 before and after the arrival of the Spanish coach, and the 2023/2024 season when Xabi had more autonomy in the formation of the squad.<br/><br/> <h3>Season 2021/2022</h3> In the 21/22 season, Leverkusen performed well in terms of results. Despite an early exit from the Europa League, beaten by Atalanta in the last 16, they finished 3rd in the Bundesliga and therefore qualified for the Champions League the following season. One of the reasons for the squad remaining very similar in the 22/23 season is precisely the good performance in 21/22.<br/><br/> In 21/22, Leverkusen conceded 47 goals and scored 80, with a good offensive record, averaging 2.4 goals per game in the Bundesliga. In addition, the German team's main players this season were Wirtz, Shick, and Demirbay.<br/><br/> <h3>Season 2022/2023</h3> The start of the 22/23 season was very different from what was imagined. With the squad maintained and, therefore, the project continuing, it was expected that the team would at least achieve a performance similar to that of the 21/22 season. However, Leverkusen got off to a terrible start and by the 9th matchday of the Bundesliga were in 15th place, close to the relegation zone. At the same time, on Matchday 3 of the Champions League, they were bottom of their group, which included Club Brugge, Porto, and Atlético de Madrid.<br/><br/> After poor results, Xabi Alonso was invited to take over the team on October 8, 2022. After the arrival of the new coach, Leverkusen finished 3rd in the Champions League group stage and qualified for the Europa League, only to fall to Roma in the semi-finals. At the end of the season, Leverkusen finished 6th in the Bundesliga and secured a place in the 2023/2024 Europa League.<br/><br/> Leverkusen's main players after Xabi Alonso took over were Wirtz, Demirbay, and Palácios. In other words, Leverkusen's highlights remained similar to the 2021 season, but Palácios was able to develop much more after the Spanish coach's arrival.<br/><br/> <h3>Season 2023/2024</h3> This season, Leverkusen need no introduction. They've won their first Bundesliga title in history and without losing a single game. Still in the Bundesliga, they've scored a total of 89 goals and conceded just 24, an average of 2.6 goals per game. Leverkusen have also conquered an average of 62% of possession per match in the Bundesliga.<br/><br/> Apart from all the prominence the team had in the Bundesliga, Leverkusen is in the final of the Europa League and is considered by many to be the favorite to win the title. The final will be played between the German club and Atalanta.<br/><br/> As for Leverkusen's highlights this season, the best players were Grimaldo, Wirtz, Palacios, Xhaka, Kovar, Hofmann, and Boniface. What's important to note is that the players signed were highlights of the team during the season, which demonstrates a clear efficiency when it comes to using players.<br/><br/> <h2>Conclusion</h2> Xabi Alonso's management has transformed Leverkusen into a highly competitive team, reflected by the unprecedented Bundesliga title win and the Europa League final. The reduction and qualification of the squad, with strategic signings and the valorization of the players already in the squad, significantly increased the team's market value. With an efficient style of play, Leverkusen not only improved their performance on the pitch, but also highlighted the ability of their players, such as Wirtz, Palacios, and new signings Xhaka, Grimaldo, Kovar, and Boniface, consolidating themselves as one of the strongest teams of the season.<br/><br/> Stay tuned to our social networks, as next week we'll be posting our final analysis of Xabi Alonso's brilliant season.<br/><br/> </div>]]></content><author><name>Ace Laboratory Football Team - Hugo Antunes</name></author><category term="Football;"/><category term="Analysis"/><category term="Football;"/><category term="Bundesliga;"/><category term="Analysis"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Se quiser ler este texto em pt-br, clique aqui.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">In-Depth Analysis of Bayer Leverkusen - Xabi Alonso’s Playing Style</title><link href="https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2024/post_leverkusen_1_en/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="In-Depth Analysis of Bayer Leverkusen - Xabi Alonso’s Playing Style"/><published>2024-05-20T10:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-20T10:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2024/post_leverkusen_1_en</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2024/post_leverkusen_1_en/"><![CDATA[<hr/> <p align="justify"> Se quiser ler este texto em pt-br, <a href="https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2000/post_leverkusen_1_pt/"> clique aqui.</a> </p> <h2>Introduction</h2> <div style="text-align: justify"> <div style="width: 90%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-05-20-post_leverkusen_1/last_minute.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> There’s been one unbeaten team in all competitions for exactly one year, since May 2023. Champions of their national league, finalists in their country’s cup and in the UEFA competition. In moments when it seems like this team is finally going to lose, they come back with an unshakeable determination, score goals in added time and maintain their unbeaten streak and sequence in championships. How did a team that hadn't attracted attention in soccer for a few years manage to become a top power in European soccer, with the longest unbeaten streak in history? In this series of posts, ACE Laboratory will analyze and identify the playing style of Bayer Leverkusen and their coach Xabi Alonso, aiming to uncover the reasons behind the magnificent run the team has done in 2024.<br/><br/> <h2>What is Xabi Alonso’s playing style?</h2> Xabi Alonso, a former player who has won every possible title and is known for being extremely technical and analytical, worked with gigantic teams and excellent coaches like Mourinho, Guardiola, and Ancelotti. Each with their different styles, Xabi managed to absorb the best qualities from each, becoming a great communicator, strategist, and football enthusiast. After completing the UEFA course, he started in Real Madrid's U-14 team and soon moved to Real Sociedad B. There, technical skills and ball control were the focus, and the club was promoted to the second division for the first time in 60 years. From there, Bayer Leverkusen saw in Xabi someone who could save the team from the critical situation of relegation, and history began to be made. But how does Bayer Leverkusen play now, having been led by Alonso for over a year?<br/><br/> <h3>Bayer Leverkusen without possession</h3> In the defensive sector, Alonso's team applies high pressure during the opponent's build-up in a mid-block, forcing errors to regain possession. Depending on the match, the German champion can adopt two different formations while defending: a 5-2-2-1, pressing the opponent's build-up with five players, crowding the midfield, and forcing plays to the sides of the field where the wing-backs press and win the ball; or a 4-2-3-1, which allows for an easier transition out of defense after stealing the ball.<br/><br/> Additionally, Leverkusen employs counter-pressing, commonly known as Gegenpressing. Xabi needed only a few months to shape and solidify this defensive tactic, establishing one of the most robust defenses in the league. By the end of the Bundesliga, they had achieved nearly 54 recoveries per match using this tactical approach.<br/><br/> <div style="width: 90%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-05-20-post_leverkusen_1/recoveries.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> The team also conceded the fewest goals in the entire Bundesliga, allowing only 24 goals, proving the efficiency of their playing style.<br/><br/> <div style="width: 90%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-05-20-post_leverkusen_1/Goals_Against.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h3>Bayer Leverkusen with possession</h3> Classified as a middle ground between Pep Guardiola's positional play and the relational play seen in Fernando Diniz's Fluminense, Xabi Alonso trains the team for a build-up that depends on the current formation on the field. The playing style, which involves many passing exchanges, is evident in the team's passing network, where we can see the formation of "triangles" that allow multiple options for a player to work the ball.<br/><br/> <div style="width: 90%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-05-20-post_leverkusen_1/passing_networks.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> Often, the wing-back Grimaldo operates defensively on the left, leaving two central defenders and a right-back to create space on the field and allow for "third man combinations." In these combinations, two players (usually Xhaka and Palacios) quickly pass the ball between themselves to draw defenders, creating space for a third player (usually Wirtz) to receive the ball. This tactic is characteristic of the relational play style.<br/><br/> In that way, the wing-backs have a much more significant role in the game, both offensively and defensively, switching sides of the field while attacking and defending. This can be observed in the passing network from the match against Augsburg, where wing-back Frimpong appeared more advanced than any other Bayer player.<br/><br/> By employing this tactic, Xabi Alonso has maximized the individual technical skills of his wide players, such as Frimpong and Grimaldo, who have contributed to 39 goals in the Bundesliga. In other words, nearly half of the team's goals have come through these two players.<br/><br/> <div style="width: 90%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-05-20-post_leverkusen_1/augsburg.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> The use of this tactic is evidenced by the number of passes made by Bayer, the highest in the Bundesliga in the 2023-24 season. Additionally, the four advanced players move a lot, preventing the opposing defenders from pushing up their defensive line.<br/><br/> <div style="width: 90%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-05-20-post_leverkusen_1/Passes_per_match.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> However, it is also common to see the team building up play with three defenders, utilizing the flanks with advanced wing-backs (usually Grimaldo and Frimpong), midfielders and forwards giving closer non-positional options, through midfield with quick transitions to attack generally architected by Wirtz or with direct passes from the defense to the attack into the empty spaces created by the team’s movementation. This is exemplified by the high number of progressive passes per game.<br/><br/> <div style="width: 90%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-05-20-post_leverkusen_1/progressive_passes.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> If the opponents remain too rigid centrally, the team starts forming narrow diamond patterns, allowing Bayer to continue doing their short and dynamic passes to reach the final third of the field. Another possibility is that if the opponents press Leverkusen's short passing exchanges, the ball is moved to the opposite flank, which will have plenty of free space.<br/><br/> Moreover, the German team doesn't rely solely on movement and masterful passing to score goals this season, since approximately 10% of all goals scored by Xabi Alonso's team have come from set-pieces. Additionally, goals from counter-attacks are also common for the German side when necessary.<br/><br/> <div style="width: 90%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-05-20-post_leverkusen_1/dead_balls.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h3>Final third of the field</h3> The final third of the German team's attack is almost unpredictable. The advance of the wing-backs through the flanks mixed with midfielders infiltrating the box, along with a bit of accurate long-range shooting, create Xabi Alonso's magical formula for the team's incredible effectiveness. Thus, a statistic that demonstrates the unpredictability of the team led by the Spanish maestro is the percentage of attacks from each offensive third of the field, with the left, middle, and right accounting for 33%, 34%, and 33% respectively.<br/><br/> Such offensive prowess not only leads to a flurry of goals and chances created for the German team but also contributes to the team's unbeaten streak, which, when being behind on the scoreboard, always finds a way, often through the tactics taught by Xabi Alonso, combined with a bit of luck, to score goals and maintain their unbeaten record intact for all season.<br/><br/> <div style="width: 90%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-05-20-post_leverkusen_1/Goal_Creating_Actions.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> A common tactic is as follows: when reaching the final third of the field, the wing-backs advance and the team's formation shifts to a 3-2-5, with the central players pushing up to receive the ball and create more options for playmaking, thus creating a numerical advantage that makes the team unpredictable and overwhelms the opposing defense. During this advancement, other players move up to occupy the midfield. The team is so efficient that it ranks in the top 3 in chances created from open play, but in comparison, has few chances from set-pieces.<br/><br/> <div style="width: 90%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-05-20-post_leverkusen_1/live_dead_balls.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h3>Weakness</h3> Due to the relational play, if the team loses the ball in the attacking side and fails apply quick pressure, the opponent has a lot of space on the flanks of the field (where the full-backs should be), since the players concentrate in a compressed manner for effective passing combinations and triangles. However, if the midfielders in transition cover the flanks, the central area becomes weakened and opportunities arise for the opponent. The system relies entirely on the players' perfection and minimizing errors. An example of this was observed in the away game against Qarabag in the UEFA Europa League, where both goals conceded were due to possession losses and effective counter-attacks by the Azerbaijani team.<br/><br/> <div style="width: 90%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-05-20-post_leverkusen_1/possession_lost.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> But, as we can see by the team’s results in the season and their goal difference stats, the risk is worth taking. <br/><br/> <div style="width: 90%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-05-20-post_leverkusen_1/Goal_Difference.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h2>Conclusion</h2> It is evident that Xabi Alonso has blended various influences and added his own product to create a team capable of an unbeaten performance in the Bundesliga. However, one of the key aspects of this team is the individuality of each player, who has fit into the Spanish coach's system while incorporating their own unique playing styles. When facing Xabi Alonso in tactical chess, one doesn't see his pieces as knights, towers, or pawns, but rather as twenty-four players with different characteristics that change the German team's playing style. These players are the reason behind the team's immense success this season and the singularity of this squad that has captivated the world. In the next post, we will analyze the evolution of these players and the team, leading to what is now known as the first team to win the first unbeaten Bundesliga title. </div>]]></content><author><name>Ace Laboratory Football Team - Caio Santos e Lucas Calmon</name></author><category term="Football;"/><category term="Analysis"/><category term="Football;"/><category term="Bundesliga;"/><category term="Analysis"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Se quiser ler este texto em pt-br, clique aqui.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Brasileirão 2024 - 5rd Round</title><link href="https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2024/post_brasileirao_5-en/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Brasileirão 2024 - 5rd Round"/><published>2024-05-06T12:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-06T12:30:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2024/post_brasileirao_5-en</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2024/post_brasileirao_5-en/"><![CDATA[<hr/> <p align="justify"> Se quiser ler este texto em pt-br, <a href="https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2000/post_brasileirao_5-pt/"> clique aqui.</a> </p> <h2>Introduction</h2> <div style="text-align: justify"> <p align="justify"> Round 5 of the Campeonato Brasileiro has come to an end, and it was a shorter one, with 3 games postponed. We'll continue our coverage of the top 4 teams in the round, analyzing the games of Athletico, Bahia, Botafogo and Atlético-MG. </p> </div> <h2>Botafogo x Bahia</h2> <div style="text-align: justify"> <div style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-05-06-post_brasileirao_5/en/bot_bah.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p align="justify"> At the Nilton Santos Stadium, Botafogo hosted Bahia in a very busy match. In the first half, both teams scored, despite a relative dominance by Bahia, who had the best chances of the match so far (xG of 1.75 against 0.22). However, we saw a very different second half, with Botafogo clearly dominating their opponents in almost every aspect (possession, chances created, shots on goal). Unfortunately for Botafogo, Bahia managed to get through the pressure without conceding, and in the 86th minute Rafael Ratão scored for the visitors, confirming an important away win. </p> </div> <h2>Athletico x Vasco</h2> <div style="text-align: justify"> <div style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-05-06-post_brasileirao_5/en/cap_vas.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p align="justify"> At the Ligga Arena, Athletico Paranaense hosted Vasco in an almost one-sided match. Furacão managed a simple victory, with only a goal scored by Erick in the first half. However, the sending off of Vasco midfielder Hugo Moura in the 16th minute was a determining factor in the match. In the first half, Athletico attacked more and accumulated 1.65 xG, while Vasco ended the first half with 0.0 expected goals. In the second half, despite being down a player, Vasco went on the attack and balanced the match. </p> </div> <h2>Fluminense x Atlético-MG</h2> <div style="text-align: justify"> <div style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-05-06-post_brasileirao_5/en/flu_cam.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p align="justify"> At the Kleber Andrade Stadium, Atlético-MG visited Fluminense, in a match marked by a heroic draw for the visiting team. Despite the balance during the first two thirds of the game, Fluminense were more effective than their opponents, scoring two goals and earning the chance to just manage the result they had built up. However, in the 73rd minute, the substitutions made by coach Gabriel Milito changed the course of the match and in just six minutes, Eduardo Vargas, coming off the bench, had already equalized for Galo. After the equalizer, Fluminense came under a bit of pressure, but the result held. </p> </div>]]></content><author><name>Ace Laboratory Football Team</name></author><category term="Football;"/><category term="Analysis"/><category term="Football;"/><category term="Brasileirao;"/><category term="Analysis"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Se quiser ler este texto em pt-br, clique aqui.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Rio Marathon 2023 – Exploratory with a bit of statistics and predictive estimation</title><link href="https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2024/post_marathon_en/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Rio Marathon 2023 – Exploratory with a bit of statistics and predictive estimation"/><published>2024-05-02T08:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-02T08:30:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2024/post_marathon_en</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2024/post_marathon_en/"><![CDATA[<p align="justify"> Se quiser ler este texto em pt-br, <a href="https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2000/post_marathon_pt/"> clique aqui.</a> </p> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-05-02-post_marathon/0.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p align="justify"> Convenience, practicality, and health benefits are some of the reasons that make running an attractive, democratic, and popular sport. That's why street running has been gaining prominence worldwide, and events like marathons already attract thousands of athletes, whether elite or amateur. In Rio de Janeiro, for example, the 21st edition of the Marathon took place over the Corpus Christi holiday in 2023, and had over 40 thousands registrations (considering all the routes), which also economically boosted the city. </p> <p align="justify"> The 42k route, which passes through the city's main landmarks, crowned kenyan Josphat Kiprotich and ethiopian Zinash Debebe as the winners of the race, both from the elite male and female pelotons. Kiprotich finished the race in 2h13min29s – two seconds faster than the previous record, while Debebe completed it in 2h36min00s. </p> <p align="justify"> In just over a month, the city will host another edition of the event, and as a stimulus for preparation, we conducted a brief exploratory analysis - with a predictive touch - on the data from the 2023 general peloton results, so that we can reveal some insights about the race. Let's check it out! </p> <p>Exploratory</p> <p align="justify"> In total, informations from 5799 athletes from the general group was analyzed, with 30% being female. Among the registrants, when we look at the age groups, the age group with the highest concentration, both for men and women, is 40-44 years old. In the graph below, we can see how this frequency occurs in the different groups: </p> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-05-02-post_marathon/1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p align="justify"> When we look at athlete frequency from the perspective of performance, we see a higher concentration of men with a finishing time of 3,5-4 hours. For the female gender, the highest concentration is in the 4-4,5 hours range. Five women completed the race in less than 3 hours. </p> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-05-02-post_marathon/2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p align="justify"> The shortest female time was 2h55min04s, while the shortest male time was 2h28min33s. The longest times were 6h39min23s and 6h42min59s, respectively, noting that we are looking at net time (time between crossing the start and finish lines). In the graph below, we can see the time distributions by gender: </p> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-05-02-post_marathon/3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p align="justify"> It is also possible to view the distribution of the final time by age group and for each declared gender: </p> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-05-02-post_marathon/4.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-05-02-post_marathon/5.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p align="justify"> For both genders, the age group that stands out for having the fastest athletes is the 30-34 age group. Additionally, the male group had 2 registered athletes over 80 years old, which increasingly shows that there is truly no age limit for sports. </p> <p>Performance prediction</p> <p align="justify"> Using as reference the article Prediction Marathon Using Artificial Intelligence [Lerebourg et al. 2023] and the article Pacing strategy of the finishers of the world marathon majors series [Kais et al. 2018], which assess the effect of variables such as gender and age on performance prediction using regression models, we also employed this information to train a multivariate regression model aiming to predict the finishing time of the race. </p> <p align="justify"> For this purpose, we used the python library <a href="https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html">statsmodels</a>, after performing all the necessary data preprocessing and splitting it into training and testing sets. Below is the graph that compares the actual time versus what was predicted by the model: </p> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-05-02-post_marathon/6.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p align="justify"> From the graph, one conclusion we can take is that the values predicted by the model don't follow the actual values as they increase. Additionally, evaluating the modeling statistics, the gender variable apparently doesn't have statistical significance in the prediction (p-value = 0.721). Therefore, there is a need to include other variables in the modeling. Some studies in the literature suggest the use of various information in prediction, such as anthropometric, physiological, biomechanical data, as well as training information like experience, step rhythm, and blood lactate concentration. </p> <p>Summary results:</p> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-05-02-post_marathon/7.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p align="justify"> Finally, the residual distribution graph, since one of the premises for a good adjustment of a linear regression model is that the residuals are normally distributed: </p> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-05-02-post_marathon/8.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p align="justify"> The distribution resembles a normal distribution, but with a slight positive skewness (left-skewed concentration). There are several tests we can perform to verify this, and some of them are already included in the summary table of results provided above. The <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.skew.html">Skewness</a>, for example, already indicates the non-normality and skewness of the error distribution (the closer to 0, the more "normal" the distribution is), and the <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.kurtosis.html">Kurtosis</a> as well, as it is associated with the flattening of the distribution (for values &gt; 3, the distribution is "higher" than the normal distribution). </p> <p align="justify"> In this case, it's important to stay vigilant in evaluating the confidence intervals, which could be incorrect. Furthermore, there are other assumptions for a good regression fit, such as a null expectation and independence of residuals, and homoscedasticity (constant variation of residuals), but as it's not the focus of this post, we'll save it for a future discussion. </p> <p>Discussion</p> <p align="justify"> In this post, we saw some descriptive statistics of the results from the 2023 Rio Marathon for the general group, visualizing how performance varies across different age groups and genders. With these data, we developed a simple performance prediction model, already raising the question of how challenging it can be to construct such a model with limited information. </p> <p align="justify"> Street running is a sport that has been growing rapidly, and the debate about which factors contributing to performance improvement is far from over. We hope to absorb and contribute more to this process over time. </p> <p align="justify"> We hope you enjoyed reading and any suggestions are welcome. </p> <p>References</p> <p>https://maratonadorio.com.br/<br/> https://www.folhavitoria.com.br/esportes/blogs/corridaderua/2023/08/17/estudo-realizado-na-maratona-do-rio-2023-comprova-o-sucesso-do-evento-deste-ano/<br/> Ülari K., et al.

We'll then analyze the games of Botafogo, Atlético-MG, Bragantino and Atlético-PR. </p> </div> <h2>Flamengo x Botafogo</h2> <div style="text-align: justify"> <div style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-04-30-post_brasileirao_4/en/fla_bot.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p align="justify"> At the Maracanã, Flamengo hosted Botafogo in a match marked by two completely opposite performances. Flamengo, despite having more possession, found it very difficult to finish their chances in a favorable way. This can be seen by comparing the number of shots (15) and shots on goal (0) by the rubro-negro team. On the other hand, Botafogo defended well without the ball and were much more efficient in attack, managing to have the best chances of the match and scoring two goals to claim another victory in the Brasileirão. </p> </div> <h2>Cuiabá vs Atlético-MG</h2> <div style="text-align: justify"> <div style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-04-30-post_brasileirao_4/en/cui_cam.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p align="justify"> At the Arena Pantanal, Cuiabá hosted Atlético-MG in a match that was dominated by their opponents. Gabriel Milito's team managed to turn the game's pace into goals in an extremely efficient manner and still not concede a goal. Despite scoring two goals from set pieces, scored by Gustavo Scarpa and Paulinho, Galo collected chances to increase the score away from home, accumulating a xG of 2.15. </p> </div> <h2>Fortaleza vs RB Bragantino</h2> <div style="text-align: justify"> <div style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-04-30-post_brasileirao_4/en/for_rbb.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p align="justify"> At the Castelão, Fortaleza and RB Bragantino played out an even contest, with both teams switching their moments of superiority. Despite the balance in possession and moments of pressure, Fortaleza managed to create more chances throughout the match, as shown by the almost constant increase in the tricolor's xG in the score line. </p> </div> <h2>Juventude vs Athletico</h2> <div style="text-align: justify"> <div style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-04-30-post_brasileirao_4/en/juv_cap.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p align="justify"> Finally, Athletico visited Juventude at the Alfredo Jaconi Stadium. Despite conceding an early goal, Athletico had the best chances, and even with a great performance from goalkeeper Gabriel Vasconcelos, they managed to tie the match. At the end of the game, Juventude applied great pressure on their opponents, taking 8 shots after 80 minutes of play, but were unable to change the outcome of the match. </p> </div>]]></content><author><name>Ace Laboratory Football Team</name></author><category term="Football;"/><category term="Analysis"/><category term="Football;"/><category term="Brasileirao;"/><category term="Analysis"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Se quiser ler este texto em pt-br, clique aqui.]]></summary></entry></feed>
