To strengthen the roster, the club signed forwards Arthur Cabral, Joaquín Correa, and the young Argentine prospect Álvaro Montoro. <br/><br/> The Rio de Janeiro's club ended up in the group considered one of the toughest, with two European giants, including the Champions League winner, Paris Saint-Germain — the Spanish powerhouse Atlético Madrid, and a strong American side, the Seattle Sounders, and still managed to finish in second place, with two wins and one loss. <br/><br/> <h3> <b> Game 1: Botafogo vs Seattle Sounders </b></h3> Botafogo defeated Seattle Sounders 2–1 in the opening round of the Club World Cup, in a match characterized by two very different halves: a dominant first half from the Brazilian side, and a second half largely controlled by the Americans. <br/><br/> Botafogo started in a 4-4-2 formation, with Igor Jesus and Mastriani up front. Savarino and Barboza returned to the starting lineup after missing the previous match. <br/><br/> Despite having 55% possession in the first half, Seattle failed to register a single shot on target. Botafogo, playing more directly, had seven shots — four on target — and scored twice, both from aerial plays. The first came from a Jair header after a free-kick delivered by Alex Telles; the second was a headed goal by Igor Jesus following a cross from right-back Vitinho. The Sounders struggled defensively in the air, winning only 36% of their aerial duels in the opening half. <br/><br/> In the second half, Seattle couldn't make it count: they had 19 shots but only 5 on target — a 26% accuracy rate. The team exchanged more passes, occupied the attacking third, and applied pressure, but were undone by poor finishing and John's saves. <br/><br/> The shift in Botafogo's defensive strategy between the two halves can be illustrated using PPDA (Passes Allowed per Defensive Action) charts. This metric is calculated by dividing the number of passes the opponent makes by the number of defensive actions (interceptions, tackles, duels, and fouls) by the analyzing team. Lower PPDA values indicate higher pressing intensity. The image below shows Botafogo's PPDA by zone in the first half. <br/><br/> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-6 offset-sm-3 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-06-26-post_world_cup/fase_de_grupos/PPDA_Firsthalf_BOTvsSEA.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Botafogo's PPDA by zone in the first half against Seattle Sounders" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <center>Botafogo's PPDA by zone in the first half against Seattle Sounders. <br/><br/></center> In the first half, Botafogo mainly pressed in the zone just beyond midfield, without applying intense high pressing near the opponent's goal but showing reasonable pressure in advanced areas. <br/><br/> In the second half, as the PPDA zone chart shows, the team clearly dropped deeper, defending mostly in their own half. This strategic shift aimed to draw Seattle forward and explore counterattacking opportunities. The image below shows Botafogo's PPDA by zone in the second half. <br/><br/> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-6 offset-sm-3 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-06-26-post_world_cup/fase_de_grupos/PPDA_SecondHalf_BOTvsSEA.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Botafogo's PPDA by zone in the second half against Seattle Sounders" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <center>Botafogo's PPDA by zone in the second half against Seattle Sounders. <br/><br/></center> Offensively, Botafogo relied heavily on full-backs Alex Telles and Vitinho, who played a key role in creating chances. Both displayed strong technical ability and were involved in most of the team's attacks — 9 of the 12 Botafogo shots featured contributions from one of them. <br/><br/> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-6 offset-sm-3 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-06-26-post_world_cup/fase_de_grupos/Rededepasses_BOTvsSEA.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Botafogo's PPDA by zone in the second half against Seattle Sounders" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <center>Botafogo's pass network against Seattle Sounders. <br/><br/></center> <h3> <b> Game 2: Botafogo vs Paris Saint-Germain </b></h3> Botafogo, despite having less than a 15% chance of winning according to Globo Esporte, defeated the reigning Champions League champions 1-0 in a thrilling match. <br/><br/> The Rio club only made one change to the starting eleven that faced the Sounders in the tournament opener. Striker Mastriani was replaced by midfielder Allan. Coach Renato Paiva opted to strengthen the midfield, given that they were up against a very strong opponent in that area. Paiva chose a 4-3-3 formation instead of the 4-4-2 used in the opening game. <br/><br/> PSG's dominance of possession was evident from the very first minutes. By the 14th minute, the French side had already completed an impressive 146 passes compared to Botafogo's 17. That pattern continued for virtually the entire match — PSG controlled the ball while Botafogo relied on a reactive strategy focused on defensive organization and quick transitions. By the end of the game, the numbers reflected this imbalance — PSG finished with 68% possession, Botafogo with 24%, and 8% of the time with the ball in contention. Overall, PSG completed 706 of their 766 passes, while Botafogo completed 215 of their 278. The offensive disparity was also clear: the French team received 256 passes in the final third, compared to just 32 for the Rio side. <br/><br/> Despite having less possession and fewer attacking opportunities, Botafogo was decisive in its actions. The team's most effective attacks came down the right flank, the origin of all four of their crosses — all of which occurred before the 55th minute, when Portuguese left-back Nuno Mendes came on. His introduction shored up PSG's defense, as has been highlighted throughout the season for his strong performances. <br/><br/> One aspect that really stood out was the finishing accuracy. PSG attempted 16 shots during the game, but only two were on target. In contrast, Botafogo was extremely efficient: they took four shots and hit the target with everyone, demonstrating remarkable finishing. Offensively, striker Igor Jesus was decisive once again — with his only shot of the game, he scored the winning goal. <br/><br/> Botafogo adopted a more defensive posture, similar to the second half against the Seattle Sounders. However, this time their lines were much more compact and close together, allowing PSG very little space to penetrate. The image below shows Botafogo's defensive actions — on the left, forced turnovers and on the right, possession recoveries. <br/><br/> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-6 offset-sm-3 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-06-26-post_world_cup/fase_de_grupos/Forced_turnovers_BOTvsPSG.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Botafogo's defensive actions against PSG" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <center>Botafogo's defensive actions against PSG: forced turnovers (left) and possession recoveries (right). <br/><br/></center> It shows how Botafogo defended with a low block, recovering the ball predominantly in their own defensive half. <br/><br/> <h3> <b> Game 3: Botafogo vs Atletico Madrid </b></h3> Needing just a draw to take the lead in Group B, Botafogo put in an excellent defensive performance, which was absolutely necessary since Atlético Madrid went into the match knowing they had to win — especially given that if PSG also won, Atlético would have to do so by more than one goal to qualify. <br/><br/> Atlético Madrid had most of the possession, with 61% compared to Botafogo's 39%, completing 508 passes versus the Brazilian team's 303, with Botafogo making only 93 passes in the second half. Atlético's shot volume was also notable — they had 23 attempts but only 5 on target, a poor conversion rate that reflects Botafogo's incredibly solid defense. Even with Atlético's lack of finishing efficiency, they produced an impressive expected goals (xG) total of 3.03 but managed only one goal, underlining Madrid's attacking shortcomings. <br/><br/> Botafogo repeated the setup they had used against PSG — a 4-3-3 with very compact lines, relying on quick attacking transitions. It was also noticeable that Botafogo pressed mostly from their own half, with little high pressing; this is evident in the team's PPDA by zone. <br/><br/> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-6 offset-sm-3 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-06-26-post_world_cup/fase_de_grupos/PPDA_BOTvsATL.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Botafogo's PPDA by zone against Atlético Madrid" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <center>Botafogo's PPDA by zone against Atlético Madrid. <br/><br/></center> The image shows Botafogo's PPDA (passes per defensive action) across different areas of the pitch. The redder the zone, the lower the PPDA — in other words, the more intense the pressing. The bluer the zone, the less pressure the team applied. By analyzing the image, we can see that Botafogo's pressing was mostly concentrated in their own half, especially in the first quarter of the field. <br/><br/> <h2> <b> Conclusion </b></h2> To sum up Botafogo's group stage in one word, it would be <b>SURPRISING</b>. Botafogo ended up in one of the toughest groups at the Club World Cup and still managed to qualify, in second place, ahead of two of Europe's top teams, even beating the reigning Champions League winner. According to Globo Esporte, before the start of the Club World Cup, Botafogo had about a 70% chance of being eliminated in the group stage, which underlines the impressive tournament the team is having by securing this qualification. <br/><br/> Overall, Botafogo delivered an outstanding performance, both offensively and defensively. Going forward, the standout was Igor Jesus, who scored two of the team's three goals in the tournament so far. He made the most of the chances that came his way and was crucial to the Rio club's qualification. The player took only 6 shots in the competition, posting a conversion rate of around 33% — one of the highest in the tournament to date. <br/><br/> It's also important to highlight the team's defensive performance. Barboza and Jair played at an extremely high level, forcing opposing teams into very poor shot conversion rates. The three teams that faced Botafogo — Seattle (21.7%), Paris Saint-Germain (12.5%), and Atlético Madrid (20.8%) — all had low shooting accuracy, which speaks volumes about Botafogo's defensive solidity. <br/><br/> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-6 offset-sm-3 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-06-26-post_world_cup/fase_de_grupos/Shot_accuracy.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Botafogo's PPDA by zone against Atlético Madrid" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <center>Shot accuracy comparison between Botafogo and their opponents. <br/><br/></center> Botafogo had an outstanding group stage, with every player demonstrating exactly why they were crowned Libertadores champions in 2024 and showcasing the power and resilience of Brazilian football against Europe's elite. <br/><br/> The standout player for Botafogo in this group stage was Alexander Barboza. He was one of the key pillars behind their qualification, with only 2 dribbles completed against him across 3 matches, leading the team in tackles, interceptions, and clearances per game. <br/><br/> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-6 offset-sm-3 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-06-26-post_world_cup/fase_de_grupos/Probabilities_GroupB.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Botafogo's PPDA by zone against Atlético Madrid" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <center>Group B qualification probabilities before the tournament. <br/><br/></center> </div>]]></content><author><name>Ace Laboratory Football Team - Brenno Santos, Antonio Magalhães</name></author><category term="Football;"/><category term="Analysis"/><category term="Football;"/><category term="Analysis;"/><category term="Club"/><category term="World"/><category term="Cup"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Botafogo's Surprising Club World Cup Group Stage Performance]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Fluminense’s Solid Group Stage Performance at the Club World Cup</title><link href="https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2025/fluminense_grupos_en/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Fluminense’s Solid Group Stage Performance at the Club World Cup"/><published>2025-06-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-06-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2025/fluminense_grupos_en</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2025/fluminense_grupos_en/"><![CDATA[<hr/> <p align="justify"> Se quiser ler este texto em pt-br, <a href="https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2000/fluminense_grupos_pt/"> clique aqui.</a> </p> <h2> <b> Introduction </b></h2> <div style="text-align: justify"> Fluminense, the Rio de Janeiro club managed by Renato Gaúcho, arrives at the World Cup at a very good moment for the club. A sequence of 6 unbeaten games for the Tricolor, which was put at risk in a group containing 3 giants from 3 different continents: Borussia Dortmund (Germany), Mamelodi Sundowns (South Africa), and Ulsan HD (South Korea). <br/><br/> <h3> <b> Game 1: Fluminense 0-0 Borussia Dortmund </b></h3> Fluminense's debut at the Club World Cup was marked by a surprising match against Borussia Dortmund. Against the main opponent in the group, Renato Gaúcho's team managed to impose their ideals for much of the game, coming dangerously close numerous times. So much so that Kobel, the German team's goalkeeper, was the best player of the match, with a rating of 8.2 (Sofascore). Despite the goalless draw and inferiority in ball possession, many considered the Brazilian team superior in the game. <br/><br/> Despite Borussia's superiority in ball possession in both parts of the game, few were the times they brought concrete danger to Fábio's goal. With the high volume of play through the wings, Fluminense managed to impose themselves through the flanks and propose play in the middle of the field, winning 67% of duels. The German team couldn't be efficient, despite managing to control the ball more (54% possession) and make more accurate passes (263). <br/><br/> In the second half, the intensity of both teams dropped, but Borussia managed to explore their ideal game a bit more. Their possession increased by 1% and the team began to win their offensive duels (55% duels won) and defensive duels (71% duels won), and this led goalkeeper Fábio to make 3 saves, the only ones of the game. Given the greater volume, this exposed the team to counterattacks — Fluminense's main chance came from a counterattack after a long pass from Hércules to Everaldo. <br/><br/> The game ended in a 0-0 draw, with 14 shots (5 on target) for Fluminense and 7 (3 on target) for Borussia. Despite inferior possession, the Tricolor demonstrated maturity to execute their offensive plays and overcome the German team's defense with their fast style of play and their speed transitions through the wings. <br/><br/> <h3> <b> Game 2: Fluminense 4-2 Ulsan HD </b></h3> Fluminense delivered a great performance against the current three-time South Korean champion, Ulsan HD. The 4-2 victory, despite some defensive lapses, was convincing. The Tricolor's game was characterized by the high positioning of players, exchanging relatively short passes in the midfield and opponent's area, resulting in an impressive 70% possession and 92% accurate passes by the end of the match. The game, however, was not without scares for Fluminense, who suffered a comeback at the end of the first half, leading Renato Gaúcho to make a bet on an even more offensive game with the exit of Ganso and the entry of Everaldo. The risk paid off, as the superiority of actions in the final third of the field yielded 3 goals and sealed Fluminense's victory. The great highlight of the match was Jhon Arias, who showed himself extremely present on both sides of the field, scoring a beautiful free-kick goal and providing an assist to Keno at the end of the game. <br/><br/> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-6 offset-sm-3 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-06-26-post_world_cup/fase_de_grupos/network_passes_flu_ulsan.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Fluminense's pass network against Ulsan HD. <br/><br/> </div> <h3> <b> Game 3: Mamelodi Sundowns 0-0 Fluminense </b></h3> In the final round, the group was wide open. Any of the teams had a chance, even if small, to qualify. In a game where Fluminense only needed a draw and Mamelodi Sundowns needed a victory, the game demonstrated the importance it was for each team — the South African team managed to neutralize various offensive weapons of the Tricolor and was superior almost throughout the entire game (67% possession in the first half and 69% in the second). This 0-0 draw is largely due to the outstanding defensive performance of Fluminense's team, with about 67% of tackles won and 42 ball recoveries. It's also important to recognize the maturity and defensive organization of the South African team, as they managed to neutralize the main player of the Rio team: Jhon Arias. He had the lowest number of actions on the ball among the 3 games (57) and couldn't shoot on goal. Renato Gaúcho knew how to play with a tactic that invited the opponent forward and managed to extract the draw, securing qualification in second place in the group. <br/><br/> <h2> <b> Conclusion </b></h2> Fluminense's group stage was not easy. They played a surprising debut match, made big mistakes despite the convincing victory in the second match, and played an extremely dull final game. The predictions showed Fluminense as the third force in this group: 39.4% chance of advancing to the round of 16, behind Mamelodi Sundowns (47.1%) and Borussia Dortmund (74.9%) (Opta). Despite this, the team managed to qualify in a difficult group. The Flu had both defensive lapses and wasted goal opportunities, which should be crucial points for improvement in the next game. <br/><br/> Offensively, the lack of rhythm due to Germán Cano's recovery is notable, as the Argentine had 5 shots on goal and missed 3 chances. The striker was gaining rhythm throughout the 3 games, but it wasn't enough to see him at his best form, which is crucial for Fluminense. Still, Cano had only fewer shots than Jhon Arias (9), who was twice elected as the best player of the match by FIFA and obtained the best Sofascore rating in all group stage games. Defensively, the Rio team had lapses against Ulsan HD, but overall, had a good performance, with clean sheets in the other two games. The good performance of the Tricolor defense — with highlights for Freytes and Renê — resulted in few shots against Fluminense, especially in the game against Mamelodi Sundowns and Borussia Dortmund; in comparison, only Ulsan HD had fewer shots in the match against the German team. With a match scheduled against Inter Milan, it wouldn't be controversial to say that Fluminense has every chance to maintain the sequence of Brazilian team qualifications in this Club World Cup. <br/><br/> </div>]]></content><author><name>Ace Laboratory Football Team - Miguel Angelo e Pedro Lopes</name></author><category term="Football;"/><category term="Analysis"/><category term="Football;"/><category term="Analysis;"/><category term="Club"/><category term="World"/><category term="Cup"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fluminense's Solid Group Stage Performance at the Club World Cup]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">NBA Playoffs : The MVPs Duel</title><link href="https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2025/nba-playoffs_en/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="NBA Playoffs : The MVPs Duel"/><published>2025-06-09T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-06-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2025/nba-playoffs_en</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2025/nba-playoffs_en/"><![CDATA[<hr/> <style>body{text-align:justify}</style> <p>Se quiser ler este texto em pt-br, <a href="https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2000/nba-playoffs_pt"> clique aqui.</a></p> <h2> <b> Introduction </b></h2> <p>The NBA, the world’s premier basketball league, is split into two conferences: the Eastern and Western. Each season begins with a regular schedule, when every team faces one another, and concludes with the playoffs, in which teams compete only against opponents from their own conference, until the NBA Finals, in which the winner of each conference plays for the league’s championship.</p> <p>This year’s Western Conference playoffs delivered one of the most thrilling seven-game series imaginable, as the top‐seeded Oklahoma City Thunder—fresh off a historic 68–14 regular season—took on the fourth‐seeded Denver Nuggets, who finished a strong 50–32. Despite their differing records, both clubs feature one of the sport’s brightest stars.</p> <p>Oklahoma City’s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Denver’s Nikola Jokić, both leading MVP contenders, put up spectacular numbers. Shai led the league in scoring, averaging 32.7 points per game, while Nikola ranked among the top three in points, rebounds, assists, and steals, producing one of the greatest individual seasons in NBA history. After each advanced through the first round, they squared off in a historic playoff showdown</p> <h3> <b> Game 1 (DEN 121 – 119 OKC) </b> </h3> <p>Denver faced a steep disadvantage heading into Game 1: they’d had just one day to rest after a grueling seven-game series against the Clippers, while Oklahoma City enjoyed an eight-day layoff. Most observers expected Denver to be overmatched.</p> <p>But Nikola Jokić—one of the season’s MVP frontrunners—put on a masterclass. He poured in 42 points on 51.7 percent shooting and hauled in 22 rebounds, spearheading a vital upset over the Thunder.</p> <p>Oklahoma City still got big nights from their stars: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 33 points, and reserve guard Alex Caruso chipped in 20 points and five steals, helping force Denver into 18 turnovers.</p> <p>ESPN Analytics gave OKC a 98 percent chance to win with six minutes left in the fourth quarter (trailers down 95–108), but Denver stormed back. Jokić alone scored 18 of his points in that final period, rallying the Nuggets to a dramatic victory.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-06-09-post-nba-playoffs/Game_1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Game1" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <h3> <b> Game 2 (DEN 106 – 149 OKC) </b> </h3> <p>In Game 2, the Thunder overwhelmed the Nuggets from the opening tip. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was nothing short of sensational, pouring in 34 points by the end of the third quarter on an almost surreal 11-for-13 shooting (84.6%). He toyed with Denver’s defense, attacking off the dribble, pulling up from midrange, and finishing through contact at the rim.</p> <p>Oklahoma City wasted no time stamping its authority. By the end of the first quarter, the home club had built a 24-point cushion, igniting the crowd and forcing Denver into its first lineup adjustments. The thunder kept rolling in the second period, and in the third, they outscored the Nuggets by an additional 17 points. With a 41-point lead as the fourth quarter began, victory was all but assured before the final buzzer.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-06-09-post-nba-playoffs/Game_2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Game2" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <h3> <b> Game 3 (DEN 113 – 104 OKC) </b> </h3> <p>In a nail-biter that stretched into overtime, the Denver Nuggets ultimately prevailed thanks to Jamal Murray’s all-around mastery. Murray poured in 27 points, dished out 8 assists and came up with 4 steals, asserting himself as the game’s defining force on both ends of the floor. His relentless pressure—both as a creator in the half-court and as a disruptor on defense—kept Denver’s momentum alive when it mattered most.</p> <p>Oklahoma City’s young wing Jalen Williams likewise turned in a spectacular performance, tallying a career-high 32 points on a blend of smooth pull-ups and aggressive drives. Yet his heroics weren’t quite enough: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, typically the Thunder’s engine, managed just 18 points on 7-for-22 shooting (31.8%), a rare off night compared to his torrid regular-season pace. And although Nikola Jokić logged heavy minutes, he never found his usual rhythm—finishing with 20 points but also losing the ball eight times, well below the MVP-level production fans have come to expect. Ultimately, Murray’s late-game poise in overtime tipped the scales in Denver’s favor.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-06-09-post-nba-playoffs/Game_3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Game3" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <h3> <b> Game 4 (DEN 87 – 92 OKC) </b> </h3> <p>Game 4 proved the roughest outing of the series. Both clubs looked out of sync, with Oklahoma City managing just a 35.6 percent field-goal rate and Denver an even lower 31.3 percent—their worst shooting marks all series.</p> <p>That offensive slump stemmed largely from fatigue. The Nuggets arrived on virtually no rest after a grueling seven-game battle with the Clippers, while the Thunder’s long layoff couldn’t fully compensate for rusty legs.

Yet in this “flu game,” Murray still poured in 25 points, lifting Denver to victory and forcing a winner-takes-all Game 7.</p> <p>And he wasn’t alone. Julian Strawther provided a key spark off the bench: in just three minutes of third-quarter action, he rattled off eight points that shifted the momentum.

This time, we’ll do something a bit different: we’ll explain what the Poisson Distribution is and walk through the step-by-step process of predicting the final score of a match. <br/><br/> <h3> <b> The Poisson Distribution </b> </h3> The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space. It assumes these events occur with a known average rate and independently of the time since the last event. <br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-05-16-post_poisson_3/image1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center>The Poisson distribution formula. <br/><br/></center> The left side of the Poisson distribution formula, P(X = k), represents the probability of exactly k events occurring in a fixed interval. Here, X is the number of events, and k is the specific number we’re interested in. <br/><br/> The numerator on the right-hand side, e<sup>-λ</sup> λ<sup>k</sup>, has two components. λ<sup>k</sup> reflects the likelihood of k events happening based on the average rate λ. The e<sup>-λ</sup> accounts for the randomness of the events, ensuring that the probability decreases as the number of events deviates from the expected rate. <br/><br/> The denominator on the right-hand side, k!, adjusts for the number of ways the k events can occur. The factorial notation calculates the number of possible arrangements, ensuring that the probability accounts for the fact that the order of events doesn’t matter. <br/><br/> <h3> <b> How to Use It in Football </b> </h3> First of all, we need to clarify something: there are several goal prediction models using the Poisson distribution, but we’re going to use the simplest one, which considers only the historical match data of the two teams. More complex models can account for other variables such as pitch quality, head-to-head records, and more. <br/><br/> To begin, we need to decide which matches we want to predict. For this post, we’ll try to predict the number of goals in a Fla-Flu derby (with Fluminense as the home team) in 2023, using data from both teams from the 2022 Brasileirão season. <br/><br/> <h3> <b> Preparing the Table </b> </h3> We used the results of all matches from the 2022 Brasileirão, sourced from the FBREF website. The data includes various pieces of information, but we only used the match results. For the next steps, we had to split the data into “Home Team,” “Away Team,” “Home Goals,” and “Away Goals.” <br/><br/> <h3> <b> Calculating Offensive and Defensive Strength </b> </h3> To predict the number of goals for a team, we first need to calculate the Offensive Strength and Defensive Strength of the teams in the Brasileirão, based on last season. <br/><br/> The Offensive Strength is the average number of goals scored by each team, both at home and away. The formula is: <br/><br/> <ul> <li>Total goals scored at home / number of games</li> <li>Total goals scored away / number of games</li> </ul> <br/><br/> In the 2022 Brasileirão season, there were 534 home goals and 371 away goals. Divided by the number of games (380), we get the average goals scored at home as 1.405, and the average goals scored away as 0.976.<br/><br/> The Defensive Strength is the average number of goals conceded by each team — which is essentially the inverse of Offensive Strength, since the number of goals scored by the home team equals the number of goals conceded by the away team. Thus, the average goals conceded at home is 0.976, and the average goals conceded away is 1.405. <br/><br/> Now we can use these league averages to calculate the strengths of the specific teams we want to analyze. <br/><br/> <h3> <b> Predicting Fluminense’s Goals </b> </h3> To calculate Fluminense’s Offensive Strength, we take the number of home goals scored by Fluminense in the 2022 season (39) and divide it by the number of home games (19) = 2.052. Then we divide this value by the league’s average home goals (1.405), giving us an Offensive Strength of 1.460.<br/><br/> Next, we calculate Flamengo’s Defensive Strength to predict how many goals Fluminense might score. We take the number of away goals conceded by Flamengo (24) and divide it by their number of away games (19) = 1.263. Then divide this by the average away goals conceded in the league (1.405), yielding a Defensive Strength of 0.898.<br/><br/> Now we can compute the expected number of goals for Fluminense by multiplying: Fluminense’s Offensive Strength (1.460) × Flamengo’s Defensive Strength (0.898) × Average Home Goals (1.405)<br/><br/> <b>1.460 × 0.898 × 1.405 = 1.845 </b> <br/><br/> <h3> <b> Predicting Flamengo’s Goals </b> </h3> To calculate the number of goals Flamengo might score, we use the same formulas, but replace the average home goals with average away goals.<br/><br/> <ul> <li>Flamengo’s Offensive Strength: (23/19) / 0.976 = 1.239</li> <li>Fluminense’s Defensive Strength: (20/19) / 0.976 = 1.078</li> </ul> <br/><br/> Now, multiply these values with the average away goals: <br/><br/> <b>1.239 × 1.078 × 0.976 = 1.305 </b> <h3> <b> Using the Poisson Distribution </b> </h3> Since no match ends in a score of 1.845 to 1.305, we use these values with the Poisson Distribution to spread 100% of the probability across possible goal outcomes for each team. We want to estimate the chance of each team scoring a specific number of goals (in our case, 0 to 5) — the number of occurrences of the event — using the expected goals (1.845 for Flu, 1.305 for Fla) - the expected occurencies. <br/><br/> We can do this easily in Python using the command:<br/><br/> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="n">poisson</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">pmf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">NumberOfOccurrences</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ExpectedOccurrences</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure> <br/><br/> Calculating this 6 times for each team, we get the following vectors: <table> <thead> <tr> <th style="color: white;">Goals</th> <th style="color: white;">Fluminense</th> <th style="color: white;">Flamengo</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="color: white;">0 goals</td> <td style="color: white;">15.80%</td> <td style="color: white;">27.11%</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="color: white;">1 goal</td> <td style="color: white;">29.15%</td> <td style="color: white;">35.39%</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="color: white;">2 goals</td> <td style="color: white;">26.90%</td> <td style="color: white;">23.09%</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="color: white;">3 goals</td> <td style="color: white;">16.54%</td> <td style="color: white;">10.05%</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="color: white;">4 goals</td> <td style="color: white;">7.63%</td> <td style="color: white;">3.28%</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="color: white;">5 goals</td> <td style="color: white;">2.82%</td> <td style="color: white;">0.86%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> Since these results are independent, the most likely result of the match is 1-1, as both teams are most likely to score 1 goal. Multiplying the probabilities of each team scoring 1 goal gives the probability of a 1-1 draw: <br/><br/> <b>0.2915 × 0.3539 = 0.1031</b><br/><br/> Using the np.outer command with these two vectors, we can generate the full probability matrix of all possible score combinations.<br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-05-16-post_poisson_3/image2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center>By summing the probabilities: Above the diagonal (Fluminense wins): 48.96% <br/> On the diagonal (Draw): 22.75% <br/> Below the diagonal (Flamengo wins): 26.91% <br/><br/></center> <h2> <b> Conclusion </b> </h2> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-05-16-post_poisson_3/image3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center>In total, we had 3 draws, 2 wins for Flamengo, and 1 win for Fluminense. When Fluminense played at home, there were two draws and one win for Fluminense. <br/><br/></center> From this result, we can compare it with the first encounter between the teams in 2023, which took place in the final round of the Taça Guanabara and ended in a 2-1 win for Fluminense. That result was the second most likely according to our model, indicating that the match followed the expected trend based on the teams’ offensive and defensive performance from the previous season. <br/><br/> Moreover, we didn’t use data from earlier 2023 Campeonato Carioca matches, which could provide more up-to-date offensive and defensive strength values — and thus a different probability distribution. <br/><br/> With this analysis, we wrap up our series of posts, where we’ve explored some predictive models applied to football and how we can use them to better understand the sport. <div> </div></div>]]></content><author><name>Ace Laboratory Football Team - Lucas Calmon, Pedro Carvalho</name></author><category term="Football;"/><category term="Analysis"/><category term="Football;"/><category term="Analysis"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Predicting Match Results in Football - Part 2</title><link href="https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2025/post-value-market_2_ing/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Predicting Match Results in Football - Part 2"/><published>2025-04-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2025/post-value-market_2_ing</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2025/post-value-market_2_ing/"><![CDATA[<p align="justify"> Se quiser ler este texto em pt-br, <a href="https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2025/post-value_market_2_pt/"> clique aqui.</a> <h2> <b> Introduction </b> </h2> <div style="text-align: justify"> In this post, we will present another method for predicting victory. This time, we will use the market value of the teams as the main variable, which corresponds to the sum of the individual market values of all players on the team. We will explore how this metric can influence the performance of clubs and their chances of winning a match. </div> <h3> <b> Context </b> </h3> <div style="text-align: justify"> Money plays a significant role in modern football. With the transfer market becoming increasingly inflated, it is necessary to spend more money in the transfer windows to maintain competitiveness in the top leagues. The professionalization of the sport has also had a great influence on increasing the cost of maintaining a team, as more expenses are now needed for infrastructure and creating a quality environment to stay ahead of the competition. In fact, studies in the Premier League and Championship (2011-2020) have shown a correlation between a team's payroll and the position the team achieves in the table (Soccernomics, Simon Kuper and Stefan Szymanski). Money drives football. Therefore, we will use the market value of the clubs in the Brazilian league to try to predict the final result of the matches. <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-04-15-post-value-market-2/img1.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <h3> <b> Method </b> </h3> <h4><b>Data</b></h4> <div style="text-align: justify"> We will use data from the 2023 season. <b></b> The dataset has two main parts: <ul> <br/> <li>The match data: information such as the home team, away team, result, match date, and odds for victory (home, draw, away), extracted from the <a href="https://football-data.co.uk/">Football-data</a> website and the Pinnacle betting house.</li> <li>The market value of the teams in the Brazilian league 2023, sourced from <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.com.br">Transfermarkt</a>.</li> </ul> Let’s take a look at our match dataset. It has about 19 fields, but only the following are relevant to us: <div style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-04-15-post-value-market-2/img2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <b>Legend:</b> home: Home team; away: Away team; res: Match result; oddHome: Home team's chance of victory; oddDraw: Chance of a draw; oddAway: Away team's chance of victory. <br/><br/> We will transform the odds into probabilities. To do this, we don't simply use the formula (1/odds), because the sum of the probabilities would exceed 1. This excess represents the bookmaker's margin, so we normalize the probabilities to correct it. <div style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-04-15-post-value-market-2/img3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> Now let's take a look at the market value data: <div style="width: 50%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-04-15-post-value-market-2/img4.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div style="text-align: justify"> The column <code>TFM_Value</code> contains the market value in millions of euros. For example, Palmeiras' market value is 138.4 million euros. These values represent the market values of the clubs as of July 20, 2024. <b></b> We have merged the two datasets, adding the market value columns for the home team (<code>tmH</code>) and the away team (<code>tmA</code>). <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-04-15-post-value-market-2/img5.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> The variable we will use to predict the results is the ratio between <code>tmH</code> (home team's market value) and <code>tmA</code> (away team's market value). More specifically, the <b>logarithm</b> of this ratio. The reason we use the log is that the distribution of the ratio between <code>tmH</code> and <code>tmA</code> is skewed to the right. Applying the log function makes the distribution symmetrical, which improves performance. The image below helps to visualize this. <div style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-04-15-post-value-market-2/img6.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-04-15-post-value-market-2/img7.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> So, the <code>logTmRatio</code> will be the variable we will use to predict the results. In other words, our independent variable. <div style="text-align: justify"> We encoded the <code>res</code> column as: <ul> <li>0: Home team victory</li> <li>1: Draw</li> <li>2: Away team victory</li> </ul> This new column will be called <code>winValue</code>. <div style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-04-15-post-value-market-2/img8.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <h3><b>Model</b></h3> <div style="text-align: justify"> We will use an <b>Ordinal Logistic Regression</b> model, which is a technique used to model the relationship between an ordinal response variable (i.e., categories with order) and one or more predictor variables. In our case, the ordinal response variable is <code>winValue</code> and the predictor variable will be <code>logTmRatio</code>. The model involves determining the \( \alpha_1 \), which is the point that separates the home team victory from the draw or away team victory. In other words, if a point falls before \( \alpha_1 \), the model will predict a home team victory, and if it falls after \( \alpha_1 \), it will predict a draw or away team victory. The \( \alpha_2 \) is the point that separates the draw from the away team victory. The \( \beta \) indicates how the predictor variable, in our case the market value ratio, influences the result. For better visualization of this explanation, observe the graph below, where \( \alpha_1 \) is represented by \( \theta_1 \): <div style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-04-15-post-value-market-2/img9.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> We used an Ordinal Logistic Regression model, which relates an ordinal response variable (<code>winValue</code>) to a continuous predictor (<code>logTmRatio</code>). The model finds two cutoff points: <ul> <li><b>\( \alpha_1 \)</b>: separates home team victory from draw or away team victory</li> <li><b>\( \alpha_2 \)</b>: separates draw from away team victory</li> <li><b>\( \beta \)</b>: tells us how this ratio influences the result of The coefficient of <code>logTmRatio</code></li> </ul> Now that we understand the model, let's prepare its training. The training dataset consists of the first 200 games of the season, and the remaining 180 games will be used as the test dataset. <div style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-04-15-post-value-market-2/img10.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <b>Model coefficients:</b><br/> \(\beta \): -0.6309<br/> \( \alpha_1 \): -0.1519<br/> \( \alpha_2 \): 0.0533 </div> <h4><b>Probability Calculation</b></h4> <div style="text-align: justify"> From these coefficients, we calculate: <ul> <li><b>Ph (home team victory)</b>: \( \frac{1}{1 + e^{-( \alpha_1 - βx)}} \)</li> <li><b>Pd (draw)</b>: \( \frac{1}{1 + e^{-( \alpha_2 - βx)}} - Ph \)</li> <li><b>Pv (away team victory)</b>: \( 1 - Ph - Pd \)</li> </ul> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-04-15-post-value-market-2/img11.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> Let's add columns to compare the prediction results from Pinnacle and what we found. <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-04-15-post-value-market-2/img12.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <h3> <b> Evaluation </b> </h3> <div style="text-align: justify"> Remember that we used the first 200 games to train our model, so we will compare the prediction results from our test set. <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-04-15-post-value-market-2/img13.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> The most important value for us is highlighted: the average accuracy of results from both the bookmaker and our model. Notice that they are close, and even the bookmaker had less than 50% accuracy. One important thing to consider when analyzing these data is the size of the training set, which only had 200 matches, and we achieved a result of a 0.03 difference from the bookmaker. Let’s create two cross tables to better understand in which types of games our model is most likely to make errors and succeed. <div style="width: 40%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-04-15-post-value-market-2/img14.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> Notice that in the draw column, our model did not predict draws, which is due to the fact that the market value ratio between two teams has a very low probability of resulting in a draw, since it is expected that the market values of the teams would need to be close to each other. <div style="width: 40%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-04-15-post-value-market-2/img15.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> The numbers are quite scattered, but we can see that our model performs better than Pinnacle in predicting away team victories, while Pinnacle has most of its correct predictions in home team victories. </div> <h2> <b> Conclusion </b> </h2> <div style="text-align: justify"> In the next post, we will discuss the prediction of results based on the Poisson distribution, a well-known distribution used to predict rare events.

Desta vez, utilizaremos como variável principal o valor de mercado dos times, que corresponde à soma dos valores de mercado individuais de todos os jogadores da equipe. Vamos explorar como essa métrica pode influenciar o desempenho dos clubes e sua chance de vencer uma partida. </div> <h3> <b> Contextualização </b> </h3> <div style="text-align: justify"> O dinheiro tem um grande papel no futebol moderno. Com o mercado de transferências cada vez mais inflacionado, mostra-se necessário gastar cada vez mais dinheiro nas janelas de transferências para manter a competitividade nas maiores ligas. A exponente profissionalização do esporte também possui grande influência no encarecimento do custo de manter um time, visto que atualmente são necessários mais gastos em estrutura e um ambiente de qualidade para se manter na frente dos demais. Inclusive, estudos na Premier League e Championship (2011-2020) mostraram que existe uma correlação entre a folha salarial de um time e a posição que esse time alcança na tabela (Soccernomics, Simon Kuper e Stefan Szymansk). O dinheiro move o futebol. Por isso, vamos utilizar o valor de mercado dos clubes do Brasileirão para tentar prever o resultado final das partidas. <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-04-15-post-value-market-2/img1.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <h3> <b> Método </b> </h3> <h4><b>Dados</b></h4> <div style="text-align: justify"> Nós iremos usar os dados da temporada 2023. <b></b> O dataset tem duas partes principais: <ul> <br/> <li>Os dados das partidas: informações como time da casa, time visitante, resultado, data da partida e odds de vitória (casa, empate, visitante), extraídas do site <a href="(https://football-data.co.uk/)">Footbal-data</a> e da casa de apostas Pinnacle.</li> <li>O valor de mercado dos times do Brasileirão 2023, retirados do site <a href="(https://www.transfermarkt.com.br)">Transfermarkt</a>.</li> </ul> Vamos agora dar uma olhada no nosso dataset das partidas. Ele possui cerca de 19 campos, mas só os seguintes nos interessam: <div style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-04-15-post-value-market-2/img2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <b>Legenda:</b> home: Time mandante; away: Time visitante; res: Resultado da partida; oddHome: Chance da vitória do time mandante; oddDraw: Chance do empate; oddAway: Chance da vitória do time visitante. <br/><br/> Iremos transformar odds em probabilidades. Para isso, não utilizamos apenas a fórmula (1/odds), pois a soma das probabilidades seria maior que 1. Esse excesso representa a margem de lucro das casas de apostas, então normalizamos as probabilidades para corrigi-la. <div style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-04-15-post-value-market-2/img3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Vamos observar os dados de valor de mercado agora:</p> <div style="width: 50%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-04-15-post-value-market-2/img4.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div style="text-align: justify"> A coluna <code>TFM_Value</code> contém o valor de mercado em milhões de euros. Por exemplo, o valor de mercado do Palmeiras é de 138,4 milhões de euros. Esses dados representam os valores de mercado dos clubes no dia 20 de Julho de 2024. <b></b> Unimos os dois datasets, adicionando as colunas de valor de mercado do time da casa (<code>tmH</code>) e do visitante (<code>tmA</code>). <div style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-04-15-post-value-market-2/img5.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> A variável que vamos utilizar para realizar a previsão de resultados é a razão entre o <code>tmH</code> (valor de mercado do time da casa) e <code>tmA</code> (valor de mercado do time da visitante). Mais especificamente o <b>logaritmo</b> dessa razão. O motivo de utilizarmos o log é pelo fato de que a distribuição da razão entre <code>tmH</code> e <code>tmA</code> estar inclinada para a direita. A aplicação da função log leva a uma distribuição simétrica, o que melhora a performance. A imagem abaixo ajudam a visualizar isso. <div style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-04-15-post-value-market-2/img6.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-04-15-post-value-market-2/img7.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>Então o <code>logTmRatio</code> será a variável que iremos utilizar para a previsão de resultados. Em outras palavras, a nossa variável independente.</p> <div style="text-align: justify"> Codificamos a coluna <code>res</code> com: <ul> <li>0: vitória do time da casa</li> <li>1: empate</li> <li>2: vitória do time visitante</li> </ul> Essa nova coluna será chamada de <code>winValue</code>. <div style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-04-15-post-value-market-2/img8.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <h3><b>Modelo</b></h3> <div style="text-align: justify"> Nós iremos usar um modelo de <b>Regressão Logística Ordinal</b> que consiste em uma técnica utilizada para modelar a relação entre uma variável de resposta ordinal, ou seja categorias que possuem ordem, e uma ou mais variáveis preditoras. No nosso caso, a variável de resposta ordinal é o <code>winValue</code> e a variável preditora será o <code>logTmRatio</code>. O modelo consiste em descobrirmos o \( \alpha_1 \) que é o ponto que divide a vitória do mandante e empate ou vitória do visitante, ou seja, se um ponto cair antes de \( \alpha_1 \), o modelo preverá a vitória do mandante e se cair após \( \alpha_1 \), preverá o empate ou vitória do visitante. Já o \( \alpha_2 \) é o ponto que divide o empate e a vitória do visitante. O \( \beta \) indica como a variável preditiva, no nosso caso a razão do valor de mercado, influencia no resultado. Para uma melhor visualização dessa explicação, basta observar o gráfico abaixo, no qual o \( \alpha_1 \) é representado por \( \theta_1 \): <div style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-04-15-post-value-market-2/img9.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> Usamos um modelo de Regressão Logística Ordinal, que relaciona uma variável resposta ordinal (<code>winValue</code>) a uma preditora contínua (<code>logTmRatio</code>). O modelo encontra dois pontos de corte: <ul> <li><b>\( \alpha_1 \)</b>: separa vitória do mandante de empate ou vitória do visitante</li> <li><b>\( \alpha_2 \)</b>: separa empate de vitória do visitante</li> <li><b>\( \beta \)</b>: nos diz como essa razão influencia o resultado do coeficiente de <code>logTmRatio</code></li> </ul> Agora que entendemos sobre o modelo, vamos preparar o seu treinamento.

In this first post, we will discuss two statistics: the winning percentage and a variation of it called the Pythagorean expectation. The data used will be from the latest seasons of major European leagues (23-24) and the Brazilian league (24), extracted from the FBREF website. <br/><br/> <h3> <b> What is the Pythagorean Expectation? </b> </h3> The Pythagorean expectation is an analytical formula initially used in baseball. It was created by Bill James, a renowned statistician and pioneer in sports data analysis, who wrote dozens of books studying baseball through statistics to determine why teams win or lose. This formula aims to estimate the percentage of games a team should have won based on the number of runs they scored and allowed. In football, the equivalent would be goals scored and goals conceded. <br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-02-12-post_pitagorica_1/image1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center>The name of the statistic comes from the similarity of its formula to the Pythagorean theorem. <br/><br/></center> Comparing a team's winning percentage with its Pythagorean expectation can help evaluate which teams are performing above expectations and which are underperforming. <br/><br/> <h3> <b> The Research </b> </h3> The data used consists of a table with all match results from each league's season, collected from <a href="https://fbref.com/pt/comps/24/cronograma/Serie-A-Resultados-e-Calendarios">FBREF</a>. <br/><br/> <h3> <b> Data Preparation and Defining Percentages </b> </h3> After extracting the data and performing basic table cleaning, the result is a DataFrame in the following format. A season consists of 380 matches, and to calculate the winning percentage and the Pythagorean expectation, we need the following information: the match result determines the team's winning percentage, while goals scored and conceded define the Pythagorean expectation. <br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-02-12-post_pitagorica_1/image2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center>This is the way the data is extracted from FBREF. <br/><br/></center> We separated each team's goals and determined the winner of each match. This allows us to calculate the winning percentage—where a win is worth 1, a draw is worth 0.5, and a loss is worth 0. The sum of these values is then divided by the number of games played (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_percentage">Wikipedia</a>). <br/><br/> After adjusting the table and calculating the teams' winning percentages, we split the data into the First Half and Second Half of the season, meaning before and after matchday 20. The table for the First Half of the season looks like this: <br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-02-12-post_pitagorica_1/image3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center> G: Number of matches played; W: Win value, used for calculating the winning percentage; GF: Goals scored; GA: Goals conceded; wpc: Winning percentage <br/><br/></center> To finalize our table, we calculate the Pythagorean expectation and merge the First and Second Half tables according to each team. <br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-02-12-post_pitagorica_1/image4.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center> Values with <b>x</b> refer to the First Half, and values with <b>y</b> refer to the Second Half. <br/><br/></center> Code for Calculating wpc and pyth: <br/> <br/> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1

The line represents a linear regression fitted to the data, showing the relationship between the two variables. <br/><br/></center> But what we really want to know is: which of these statistics has a stronger relationship with a team’s winning percentage at the end of the season? To analyze this, we can generate a correlation table comparing these statistics between the First Half and Second Half of the season. <br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-02-12-post_pitagorica_1/image6.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center> Premier League correlation table. <br/><br/></center> As seen in the highlighted values, <b>pythagorean_x</b> has a stronger correlation with <b>win_percentage_y</b> (0.80) than <b>win_percentage_x</b> with <b>win_percentage_y</b> (0.75). While this difference is small, it suggests that the Pythagorean expectation has slightly better predictive power than the winning percentage. This is the result for the Premier League. What about other leagues? <br/><br/> <h4> <b> Bundesliga </b></h4> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-02-12-post_pitagorica_1/image7.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center> Bundesliga correlation table. <br/><br/></center> <h4> <b> La Liga </b></h4> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-02-12-post_pitagorica_1/image8.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center> La Liga correlation table. <br/><br/></center> <h4> <b> Serie A </b></h4> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-02-12-post_pitagorica_1/image9.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center> Serie A correlation table. <br/><br/></center> <h4> <b> Ligue One </b></h4> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-02-12-post_pitagorica_1/image10.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center> Ligue One correlation table. <br/><br/></center> As observed, in the German, Spanish, and Italian leagues, the values are slightly lower, but the Pythagorean expectation still has better predictive power than the winning percentage. In the French league, despite the correlation between First Half and Second Half results being below 50%, the Pythagorean expectation still outperforms the winning percentage. So far, everything aligns with expectations. However, things get interesting when we analyze the Brazilian league. <br/><br/> <h4> <b> Brasileirão </b></h4> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-02-12-post_pitagorica_1/image11.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center> Brasileirão correlation table. <br/><br/></center> In the Brazilian league, not only do First Half values have less than 30% correlation with Second Half results, but the winning percentage also has a <b>higher correlation</b> than the Pythagorean expectation! This is the only one of the six leagues studied where this phenomenon occurs. <br/><br/> <h2> <b> Conclusion </b></h2> Based on the experiment’s results, we decided to analyze how much team performance fluctuates between the two halves of the season, depending on the league, to better understand the most ‘unpredictable’ leagues. To do this, we calculated the mean and median of this variation across all studied leagues. The <b>Brasileirão stood out as the competition with the highest fluctuation between halves</b>, surpassing European leagues. Surprisingly, La Liga showed a relatively high variation for European standards. <br/><br/> <table> <thead> <tr> <th style="color: white;">Leagues</th> <th style="color: white;">Median Performance Difference</th> <th style="color: white;">Mean Performance Difference</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="color: white;">Premier League</td> <td style="color: white;">20.78%</td> <td style="color: white;">27.13%</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="color: white;">La Liga</td> <td style="color: white;">21.64%</td> <td style="color: white;">36.83%</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="color: white;">Ligue 1</td> <td style="color: white;">23.25%</td> <td style="color: white;">32.35%</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="color: white;">Série A</td> <td style="color: white;">18.61%</td> <td style="color: white;">27.39%</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="color: white;">Bundesliga</td> <td style="color: white;">21.30%</td> <td style="color: white;">26.35%</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="color: white;">Brasileirão</td> <td style="color: white;">32.14%</td> <td style="color: white;">38.76%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br/><br/> <h4>Performance Difference Calculation:</h4> \[ \left( \frac{\text{Second Half Performance}}{\text{First Half Performance}} - 1 \right) \times 100\% \] <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-02-12-post_pitagorica_1/image12.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center> variation in Brazilian clubs’ performances between the First and Second Halves of the Brasileirão. <br/><br/></center> The graph above illustrates the high variation in Brazilian clubs’ performances between the First and Second Halves of the Brasileirão. Teams like Vitória, Grêmio, Fluminense, and Corinthians had poor results in the first half but above-average performances in the second half. Meanwhile, Atlético Mineiro, Cruzeiro, and Bahia performed well in the first half but declined in the second. Why does this happen? <br/><br/> We can speculate on some possible reasons, such as increased investment over time, frequent coaching changes, or fan pressure after poor results, which forces club management to invest more in reinforcements. However, determining the real cause would require a more in-depth study on the subject. <br/><br/> In the next post, we will discuss predicting outcomes based on the clubs' market value, which will be our primary variable.

The event featured 5km and 15km routes and is renowned for the significant challenges in the longer-distance course: nearly 4km of uphill segments, with certain points becoming quite steep. </p> <p align="justify"> A total of 1.973 runners completed the race, with 1.010 in the 5km course and 963 in the 15km course. Here's an interesting detail: in the shorter distance, the majority of participants were women (around 63%), while in the longer distance, the majority were men, with women accounting for 38% of the participants. </p> <p align="justify"> As it is well known that weather conditions can directly impact athletes performance, it's worth noting that the race started at 6:30am and that during the event, the sky was heavily overcast, with occasional drizzle. According to some participants, the early start time combined with the weather conditions contributed positively to their performance on the course, as December tends to be very hot in Niterói. </p> <p>Let’s dive into the analysis!</p> <p align="justify"> The goal of this post is to analyze the performance of some participants to shed light on and validate certain hypotheses that we already know from other studies and related work. </p> <p align="justify"> Ten athletes who participated in the race and used the <a href="https://www.strava.com/">Strava</a> app provided consent to participate in the analysis and shared the race data collected by the app. This dataset includes information such as speed, distance, compass, and more. Additionally, the volunteer runners completed a brief questionnaire containing details about their training, race preparation, and experience. </p> <p>In general, regarding the participants:</p> <ul> <li>All of them had a habit of running and practicing other exercises;</li> <li>Only 4 had previously run the race course;</li> <li>9 out of the 10 participants prepared for the race in a more comprehensive manner.</li> </ul> <h2>Exploratory</h2> <p align="justify"> The data extracted from Strava and provided by the participants were imported into Python for a more detailed exploratory analysis. It is important to note that we removed 2 runners from the analysis due to inconsistent data — most likely caused by GPS data capture failures during the race. </p> <p align="justify"> In the chart below, you can visualize the performance of each participant (average pace) by distance covered: </p> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-01-28-post_sao_garrafa/imagem_2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p align="justify"> Right from the start, runners 1, 5, 6, and 10 stand out for maintaining a low pace throughout the entire course — around 4'30" on average. Coincidence? Probably not, as these were the 4 runners who had trained on the race course before the event. To simplify the understanding from here on, we will refer to this group as the "course-savvy runners". This point highlights just how crucial preparation and knowledge of the course are before taking on a challenging race. </p> <p align="justify"> Notice that between kilometers 5 and 8, all athletes showed a decrease in their speeds (increase in pace). This is exactly the part of the course with a very steep uphill, where it is quite difficult to maintain the pace. Here, a statistical test was conducted to compare the pace of the course-savvy runners with those who were not familiar with the course, and it can be stated that there is a statistically significant difference (p-value &lt; 0.05) in the speeds of these two groups at this segment of the course. </p> <p align="justify"> In this other chart, it's also possible to visualize the performance of each participant, but now by race time. Once again, the course-savvy runners stand out for, unsurprisingly, being the ones to finish the race the fastest. </p> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-01-28-post_sao_garrafa/imagem_1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p align="justify"> In general, the course-savvy runners were at a walking speed (established here as 5 km/h) less frequently compared to the non-savvy runners. Another point that reinforces the idea that "more trained" athletes naturally perform better is their experience time. The course-savvy runners have an average of 5 years of running experience each, while the non-savvy runners have an average of 1 year. </p> <p align="justify"> It was also possible to compare performance by elevation range (in meters), as shown in the chart below. Runners 1 and 5 stand out for their minimal pace fluctuations as the elevation level increases, demonstrating their ability to maintain a nearly constant pace, as shown above. A previous study delves deeper into this point, suggesting that more experienced runners show fewer fluctuations in their speed series, meaning fewer abrupt changes.

It is likely that their prior knowledge of the course allowed these runners to better adapt to the challenges. It is important to mention that there are other variables not considered in this analysis, such as nutrition, injury history, age, body anatomy, among others, which, according to the literature, also influence the results. </p> <p align="justify"> Our goal was to illustrate in a real case how some of these variables are connected and to raise the challenge for future work considering other influencing factors for performance evaluation—and even prediction. </p> <p>Any suggestions are welcome!</p> <h2>References</h2> <p>https://neorace.com.br/resultados/g-live.html?f=2024%2Fdez%2Fsgf%2Fsgf.clax</p> <p>TITO, Nathália; PAIXÃO, Balthazar; TAVARES, Lucas G.; OGASAWARA, Eduardo; AMORIM, Glauco F..

This time, we'll be using data that takes into account all 38 rounds of the championship (in the first post, the championship was still in its 29th round). <br/><br/> It's worth noting that we'll continue to focus our analysis on the players selected using the criteria explained in the <a href="https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2024/post_contratacoes_1_en/"> last post</a>: <b> Luiz Henrique </b> (Botafogo), <b> Felipe Anderson </b> (Palmeiras), <b> Gustavo Scarpa </b> (Atlético-MG), <b> Breno Lopes </b> (Fortaleza), <b> André Silva </b> (São Paulo), <b> Everton Ribeiro </b> (Bahia), <b> Gabriel Veron </b> (Cruzeiro), <b> David </b> (Vasco), <b> Soteldo </b> (Grêmio), <b> Wesley </b> (Internacional), <b> Rodrigo Garro </b> (Corinthians), <b> Yannick Bolasie </b> (Criciúma), <b> Lucas Barbosa </b> (Juventude) and <b> Gonzalo Mastriani </b> (Athletico). <br/><br/> In addition, we decided to include and focus the analysis on three more players who stood out during the year and fit the criteria used: <b> Alerrandro </b> (Vitória), <b> Memphis Depay </b> (Corinthians) and <b> Kevin Serna </b> (Fluminense). Finally, the players used for comparison will also be the same as in the last post and will be represented in yellow, while the signings will be represented in blue. <br/><br/> <h3> <b> Decisive goals and assists </b> </h3> To begin with, let's try to quantify the decision-making power of these players. To do this, we'll use the decisive goal participations metric, which counts <b> goals or assists that happened while the game was tied or while the player's team was losing by one goal </b>. <br/><br/> In the following graph, the red bar represents the number of decisive goal participations, while the blue bubble represents the number of total participations. <br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-12-16-post_contratacoes_2/decisiveGoalsAssists.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center>Graph 1. Decisive goal participations in red, and total goal participations in blue <br/><br/></center> - One player stands out in a very negative way: <b> Felipe Anderson </b> (Palmeiras). Especially for a player who came straight from one of Europe's big five leagues, a single decisive goal in 14 minutes can be considered a disappointing result. <br/><br/> - <b> Alerrandro </b> was one of the highlights of the Brasileirão. As well as being top scorer (tied with Corinthians' <b> Yuri Alberto </b>), he was extremely decisive for Vitória (especially in the final stretch, when he scored 8 decisive goals in the last 9 rounds), who finished in 11th place. <br/><br/> If we also take into account the number of minutes played, dividing the number of participations in goals by the number of games (90 minutes), the ranking changes shape a little, leaving room for new observations: <br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-12-16-post_contratacoes_2/decisivePer90.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center> Graph 2. Decisive participations in goals per 90 minutes in red, and total participations in goals per 90 minutes in blue <br/><br/></center> - From this graph, you can see the impact of <b> Memphis Depay </b>, from Corinthians, much more clearly. He was the signing with the most decisive appearances per game, as well as having an impressive 0.9 goals per game. It's worth noting that, after round 27 (<b> Memphis </b>' debut), Corinthians had won 28 out of a possible 33 points (84% points!). <br/><br/> - Even taking into account the ratio of decisive goals to minutes on the field, <b> Alerrandro </b> (24!) continues to lead the statistics among the selected signings, scoring approximately 1 decisive goal every two matches. <br/><br/> - Another player worth mentioning is <b> Kevin Serna </b>, from Fluminense. The Colombian arrived in the mid-year transfer window and was essential to his team's escape from relegation, scoring an average of one decisive goal every two matches. It's also worth mentioning that all of the Colombian's goal participations were decisive. <br/><br/> <h3> <b> General Analysis </b> </h3> In the graphs below, we have used the same model used in the first part of the series of posts. However, we've updated the data and also added the other players who fit the criteria to be selected (<b> Alerrandro </b>, <b> Memphis Depay </b> and <b> Kevin Serna </b>). <br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-12-16-post_contratacoes_2/totalShotsper90_vs_xGper90.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center> Graph 3. Total Shots per 90 minutes x Expected Goals per 90 minutes <br/><br/></center> - <b> Memphis Depay </b> is one of the players with the most shots per game in the league. However, it's interesting to note that this high number of shots is not reflected in expected goals. One interpretation is that <b> Memphis </b>, being a player with well above-average technical quality, attempts a lot of shots from outside the box or in difficult conditions, thus not accumulating a high number of expected goals. <br/><br/> - On the other hand, <b> Alerrandro </b> accumulates an average of expected goals per game very similar to <b> Memphis Depay </b>, even though he shoots considerably less, indicating less risk-taking and opting to shoot only when he is in clearer scoring conditions. In addition to this difference in characteristics, the positioning of the players on the pitch also influences this different behavior: <b> Alerrandro </b> is a center forward by trade, while <b> Memphis </b> is a second striker, forming attacking duos. <br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-12-16-post_contratacoes_2/xg_vs_goals.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center> Graph 4. Goals per 90 minutes vs. Expected Goals per 90 minutes <br/><br/></center> - Once again, we have to mention <b> Memphis Depay </b> as an individual highlight. Among the players considered (minutes equivalent to at least 8 games), <b> Memphis </b> was the second player with the most goals per game (as a matter of curiosity, the first was <b> Eduardo Vargas </b>, from Atlético-MG). However, it's not just the number of goals per game that's impressive, but also the player's efficiency. <b> Memphis </b> had 0.44 expected goals/game and 0.79 goals/game (almost double!). <br/><br/> - <b> André Silva </b>, from São Paulo, also deserves a mention. Despite initially being signed as a backup for the already established <b> Jonathan Calleri </b>, the Brazilian finished the league with more goals, even though he had fewer expected goals (taking into account the players' minutes), showing, at least in a quick analysis, that he was a more efficient striker than the Argentine. <br/><br/> <h2> <b> Conclusion </b></h2> In summary, this second part of the post shows a little more about the impact of some signings in the attacking sector of Brazilian soccer. While some stood out in an extremely positive way, such as <b> Memphis Depay </b> and <b> Alerrandro </b>, being decisive and essential to their respective teams' campaigns, other players didn't have the expected effect, such as <b> Felipe Anderson </b>, from Palmeiras. <br/><br/> Furthermore, our analysis showed that the simplest metrics we used, although useful in many contexts, have limitations in capturing the full impact of certain players. In order to understand the real impact of players like <b> Everton Ribeiro </b> and <b> Luiz Henrique </b>, for example, who have been essential to their teams, it is necessary to combine different types of metrics that consider different contexts, and it is also recommended to use other types of data, such as event data. In this way, we can evaluate not only direct production in raw numbers, but also less obvious (but no less important) contributions, such as playmaking and tactical influence. <br/><br/> <div> </div></div>]]></content><author><name>Ace Laboratory Football Team - Daniel Barros, Hugo Antunes</name></author><category term="Football;"/><category term="Analysis"/><category term="Football;"/><category term="Analysis"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Analyzing Brazilian Football Signings in 2024 - Offensive Sector</title><link href="https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2024/post_contratacoes_1_en/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Analyzing Brazilian Football Signings in 2024 - Offensive Sector"/><published>2024-10-10T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-10-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2024/post_contratacoes_1_en</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2024/post_contratacoes_1_en/"><![CDATA[<hr/> <p align="justify"> Se quiser ler este texto em pt-br, <a href="https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2000/post_contratacoes_1_pt/"> clique aqui.</a> </p> <h2><b>Introduction </b></h2> <div style="text-align: justify"> In this series of posts, we'll bring you statistics on the main signings made by teams in Brazil's Serie A! To do this, we've separated the players into sectors: attack, midfield and defense. In this first post, we'll talk about the attackers that Brazilian clubs have invested (some of them a lot of) money in. For a better comparison, we've also chosen to showcase some players who aren't 2024 signings, precisely to compare the new players with others already established in Brazilian soccer. <br/><br/> <h3> <b> The signings </b> </h3> Our criteria for selecting players was to choose the player recruited in 2024 with the most minutes in the team for each sector (with a minimum minute equivalent to 8 matches), prioritizing teams that have greater purchasing power and have made more significant signings in the elite of Brazilian soccer. The players selected for the attacking sector were: <b>Luiz Henrique</b> (Botafogo), <b>Felipe Anderson</b> (Palmeiras), <b>Gustavo Scarpa</b> (Atlético-MG), <b>Breno Lopes</b> (Fortaleza), <b>André Silva</b> (São Paulo), <b>Everton Ribeiro</b> (Bahia), <b>Gabriel Veron</b> (Cruzeiro), <b>David</b> (Vasco), <b>Soteldo</b> (Grêmio), <b>Wesley</b> (Internacional), <b>Rodrigo Garro</b> (Corinthians), <b>Yannick Bolasie</b> (Criciúma), <b>Lucas Barbosa</b> (Juventude) and <b>Gonzalo Mastriani</b> (Athletico). <br/><br/> Some clubs haven't made any signings in the attacking sector, while others have, but the signings haven't played more than the equivalent of 8 matches. In both cases, there is no player representing the team in the comparison. <br/><br/> <h3> <b> Analysis and Comparison of the New Players </b> </h3> The data used for this analysis refers exclusively to the Brazilian Championship, covering matches up to the 29th round. It is worth noting that, due to postponements, not all teams have played 29 matches. <br/><br/> To begin the analysis, we will use two graphs which, although similar in scope, offer different perspectives. The first graph relates the number of shots to the expected goals, providing an insight into the <b>quantity and quality of chances that players receive</b>, on average, per match. The second graph relates expected goals (xG) to goals scored, making it easier to analyze <b>how players take advantage of the chances created</b>. In both graphs (and the third one too), the players signed this season are represented in cyan, while the green dots indicate players used as references. <br/><br/> The first graph shows average lines on both axes, which helps to identify players who are above or below average in each metric, dividing the graph into four quadrants. In the Goals vs. xG graph, a single line was used, dividing the graph into two quadrants: above the line are the players who scored more goals than expected; below the line, those who scored less than expected. <br/><br/> <div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-10-10-post_contratacoes/shots_vs_xg.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center>Graph 1. xG per 90 x Shots Per 90<br/><br/></center> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-10-10-post_contratacoes/xg_vs_goals.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <center>Graph 2. Goals per 90 x xG per 90 <br/><br/></center> <ul> <li> <p>Among the players signed this season, <b>Gonzalo Mastriani** and <b>Yannick Bolasie</b> stand out in terms of the number of shots and goals expected. Their statistics in these metrics are similar to those of other players who can be considered the main finishers for their respective teams, such as <b>Hulk<b>, <b>Pablo Vegetti</b> and <b>José López</b> (Flaco López). <br/><br/></b></b></b></p> </li> <li> <p>It’s also worth highlighting the efficiency of São Paulo’s center forward, <b>André Silva</b>. Although he doesn’t have a very high number of expected shots and goals, he stands out in the number of goals scored, being the player furthest away from the middle line and can therefore be considered the “most efficient” of the signings shown. <br/><br/></p> </li> <li> <p>In contrast, <b>Everton Ribeiro</b> has low values in these metrics directly related to finishing moves. This highlights a big difference between him and the rest of the strikers being compared. <b>Everton Ribeiro</b>, as we’ll see later, is not a player marked by direct participation in finishing moves, but rather in constructing them. In the graph, he is in the bottom left quadrant, which suggests that he plays a lesser role in both shooting and scoring goals in a match. <br/><br/></p> </li> <li> <p>Although it’s not the main focus of this analysis, it’s important to mention young <b>Estevão</b>, from Palmeiras. Although he is not a new signing, he “emerged” in the elite of Brazilian soccer in 2024. Despite not being a center-forward, he is one of the players who finishes the most, as well as accumulating high numbers of expected goals and goals per game.

Introduction In this series of posts, we'll bring you statistics on the main signings made by teams in Brazil's Serie A! To do this, we've separated the players into sectors: attack, midfield and defense. In this first post, we'll talk about the attackers that Brazilian clubs have invested (some of them a lot of) money in. For a better comparison, we've also chosen to showcase some players who aren't 2024 signings, precisely to compare the new players with others already established in Brazilian soccer. The signings Our criteria for selecting players was to choose the player recruited in 2024 with the most minutes in the team for each sector (with a minimum minute equivalent to 8 matches), prioritizing teams that have greater purchasing power and have made more significant signings in the elite of Brazilian soccer. The players selected for the attacking sector were: Luiz Henrique (Botafogo), Felipe Anderson (Palmeiras), Gustavo Scarpa (Atlético-MG), Breno Lopes (Fortaleza), André Silva (São Paulo), Everton Ribeiro (Bahia), Gabriel Veron (Cruzeiro), David (Vasco), Soteldo (Grêmio), Wesley (Internacional), Rodrigo Garro (Corinthians), Yannick Bolasie (Criciúma), Lucas Barbosa (Juventude) and Gonzalo Mastriani (Athletico). Some clubs haven't made any signings in the attacking sector, while others have, but the signings haven't played more than the equivalent of 8 matches. In both cases, there is no player representing the team in the comparison. Analysis and Comparison of the New Players The data used for this analysis refers exclusively to the Brazilian Championship, covering matches up to the 29th round. It is worth noting that, due to postponements, not all teams have played 29 matches. To begin the analysis, we will use two graphs which, although similar in scope, offer different perspectives. The first graph relates the number of shots to the expected goals, providing an insight into the quantity and quality of chances that players receive, on average, per match. The second graph relates expected goals (xG) to goals scored, making it easier to analyze how players take advantage of the chances created. In both graphs (and the third one too), the players signed this season are represented in cyan, while the green dots indicate players used as references. The first graph shows average lines on both axes, which helps to identify players who are above or below average in each metric, dividing the graph into four quadrants. In the Goals vs. xG graph, a single line was used, dividing the graph into two quadrants: above the line are the players who scored more goals than expected; below the line, those who scored less than expected. Graph 1. xG per 90 x Shots Per 90 Graph 2. Goals per 90 x xG per 90 Among the players signed this season, Gonzalo Mastriani** and Yannick Bolasie stand out in terms of the number of shots and goals expected. Their statistics in these metrics are similar to those of other players who can be considered the main finishers for their respective teams, such as Hulk, Pablo Vegetti and José López (Flaco López). It’s also worth highlighting the efficiency of São Paulo’s center forward, André Silva. Although he doesn’t have a very high number of expected shots and goals, he stands out in the number of goals scored, being the player furthest away from the middle line and can therefore be considered the “most efficient” of the signings shown. In contrast, Everton Ribeiro has low values in these metrics directly related to finishing moves. This highlights a big difference between him and the rest of the strikers being compared. Everton Ribeiro, as we’ll see later, is not a player marked by direct participation in finishing moves, but rather in constructing them. In the graph, he is in the bottom left quadrant, which suggests that he plays a lesser role in both shooting and scoring goals in a match. Although it’s not the main focus of this analysis, it’s important to mention young Estevão, from Palmeiras. Although he is not a new signing, he “emerged” in the elite of Brazilian soccer in 2024. Despite not being a center-forward, he is one of the players who finishes the most, as well as accumulating high numbers of expected goals and goals per game. That’s impressive, considering he’s only 17 years old and is in his debut season in the league. Finally, we chose another graph to visualize participation with the ball and the number of passes in the final third of the pitch. The interesting thing about this visualization is that we were able to ‘divide’ the players into three groups, where it’s possible to understand why the player belongs to each group according to their individual and team characteristics. Graph 3. Accurate Final Third Passes per 90 x Touches per 90 The center forwards, such as Yannick Bolasie, Gonzalo Mastriani and André Silva, are below average both in terms of the number of touches they get on the ball and the number of correct passes in the final third. This isn’t necessarily a demerit, but a characteristic of the role. Center forwards tend to receive the ball less than most other players, and when they do, they’re often put under a lot of pressure, which increases the chance of a misplaced pass. On the other hand, attacking players who are more constructive, such as Rodrigo Garro, Gustavo Scarpa and Everton Ribeiro, are above average in these two metrics. Everton Ribeiro, in particular, stands out from the rest, both because of his individual characteristics and because of the way Bahia uses him. The team sees him as a key player in the offensive progression, taking advantage of his superior technical quality, which makes him the main player in the construction of plays and participation with the ball. Located on the graph between these two groups are the players most characterized by dribbling, such as Wesley, Luiz Henrique, Lucas Barbosa and David. The interpretation is that, despite having a number of touches and passes in the final third close to the average, these players progress in a different way to the builders. They prefer to advance with the ball through quick and, in some cases, long carries. In addition, they tend to be more involved in finishing off moves, which is why they often don’t receive the ball back in the same move after receiving it. Conclusion In summary, the attacking signings of Serie A clubs in 2024 reveal different player profiles, reflecting the specific characteristics of each team and their tactical needs. While central strikers such as Bolasie and Mastriani stand out for their finishing, although with less involvement in the build-up play, more creative and constructive players such as Rodrigo Garro and Everton Ribeiro play a key role in attacking progression. On the other hand, players who focus on dribbling, such as Wesley and Luiz Henrique, take a different approach, with a greater emphasis on carrying and dribbling. These distinctions reveal how the teams function differently, whether because of economic reality, the rest of the squad, or the choice of the coaching staff.]]></summary></entry></feed>
