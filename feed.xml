Flamengo, for their consistency and defensive solidity, and Nova Iguaçu, who stood up to the big teams in Rio de Janeiro with a much smaller budget, revealing very competent players and coaches.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Carioca Championship 2024 - Final - First Leg</title><link href="https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2024/post_carioca_final1-en/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Carioca Championship 2024 - Final - First Leg"/><published>2024-04-03T11:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-03T11:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2024/post_carioca_final1-en</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2024/post_carioca_final1-en/"><![CDATA[<hr/> <p align="justify"> Se quiser ler este texto em pt-br, <a href="https://ac3lab.github.io/blog/2000/post_carioca_final1-pt/"> clique aqui.</a> </p> <h2>Introduction</h2> <div style="width: 55%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-03-07-post_carioca_compilado/Carioca_2024_FERJ.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div style="text-align: justify"> <p align="justify"> After waiting some time, last Saturday we had the first leg of the Campeonato Carioca 2024 final.

During this period, the Brazilian national team faced England in their first friendly match, and we're going to analyze the teams' performances and the main highlights of the match. </p> <h2>England x Brazil</h2> <div style="text-align: justify"> <p align="justify"> On this FIFA World Cup date, the Brazilian national team faced an even greater challenge, with a new coach, injured key players and the weight of a poor season last year. This is a short period of training and adjustments, but the importance of playing a friendly against a top team and the need for victory spoke louder, and even with all these obstacles, Brazil created chances and managed to beat England by the minimum score, with a goal from Endrick, who was one of the highlights of the match. </p> <p align="justify"> On the other side, England, who have been working harder with a longer-serving coach and a more settled team, but who also had a lot of injured players, were unable to beat the Brazilian national team. The English national team hadn't lost a game since 2022, when they were knocked out of the World Cup in the quarter-finals by France. </p> </div> <h3>Match Analysis</h3> <div style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-03-25-brasil_inglaterra/en/game1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div style="text-align: justify"> <p align="justify"> Brazil’s first game with a new coach and only 5 days of training managed to excite Brazilian supporters, with a solid defense and creative offensive power, made possible by the genius of Lucas Paquetá. </p> <p align="justify"> The almost equal ball possession (53% / 47%) shows what a back-and-forth game it was, with intensity and changes of control that could be one of a World Cup game. Despite that parity, Brazil's dominance is shown by the 12 (!!!) shots from inside Pickford's zone, with only 2 being shot from outside. And England, even though having lost offensive power with Harry Kane's being injured, still managed to shot 14 times, 7 being from inside Bento's zone. </p> </div> <h3>Highlights</h3> <div style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-03-25-brasil_inglaterra/en/highlights-player1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div style="text-align: justify"> <p align="justify"> The game was very close for both teams. The midfield of both sides had to work a lot more than the others. For comparison, we brought Lucas Paquetá and Declan Rice with very similar statistics, both in the offensive and defensive actions of the midfield. But, Lucas led anyway with the most Key passes (3x2), tackles (3x2) and correct passing rate (94% x 91%), living up to the title of MOTM.</p> <p align="justify"> On the offensive side of the field, Rodrygo and Anthony Gordon were the highlighted players of both teams, with the Brazilian leading the successful dribbles rate duel <b>(100% to 80%)</b> and an almost perfect passing rate <b>(96%)</b>. However, when it comes to shots on target, posing more threats for the opposite team, Gordon leads with <b>2 Shots on target</b> against <b>1 Shot</b> by the Real Madrid’s player. </p> <p align="justify"> The Defensive brazilian sector was led by Danilo, who had incredible <b>7 Clearances</b>, <b>4 duels won</b> and <b>2 shots blocked</b>. On other hand, Ben Chilwell, despite being a defensive player, participated a lot in the offensive and the midfield sectors, with <b>2 shots on target</b>, same as Anthony Gordon, and <b>100% long balls accuracy</b>, materializing as an incredible player involved in all sides of the field. </p> </div>]]></content><author><name>Ace Laboratory Football Team</name></author><category term="Football;"/><category term="Analysis"/><category term="Football;"/><category term="Carioca;"/><category term="Analysis"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction FIFA dates are excellent times for national teams to adjust their tactical schemes and try out new players.

Flamengo held Fluminense to a draw and secured their place in the finals, and Nova Iguaçu, the big surprise of the competition, eliminated Vasco with a 1-0 win at Maracanã stadium. Now, let's analyze the data from these games and evaluate the teams' performances. </p> </div> <h2>Flamengo x Fluminense</h2> <div style="text-align: justify"> <h3>Match Analysis</h3> <div style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-03-20-post_carioca_semifinal_2/en/game1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p align="justify"> Flamengo did their job and finished another game without conceding a goal. The club managed to prevent the tricolor from creating danger in their area, which is demonstrated by the fact that only <b>4 of Fluminense's 14 shots</b> came from inside the area, and none of them went towards goalkeeper Agustín Rossi. Playing on the counter-attack and without possession of the ball, Flamengo managed a higher xG than their opponent (<b>1.38 x 0.98</b>), having 5 fewer shots. </p> <p align="justify"> Fluminense this time played the way they prefer, having the most time with the ball (<b>63%</b>) and exchanging more than twice as many passes as their opponent (<b>543 x 242</b>). However, we saw this possession not converted into real chances, Flamengo's defensive scheme nullifying Fluminense's attack, which had <b>0 shots on goal</b> in the 1st and 2nd leg, even though the tricolor improved their attacking performance for the second leg. </p> <p align="justify">As a result, we can see that even though Fernando Diniz's team dictated the game, they were unable to beat Flamengo's defense, which still only conceded 1 goal in the entire competition. Flamengo goes to the finals as favorites, but they will face Nova Iguaçu, the only team to have managed to score a goal against them, and they will be hungry to win this cup as the underdogs of the championship. </p> <h3>Highlights</h3> <div style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-03-20-post_carioca_semifinal_2/en/players1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p align="justify"> The game didn't have any great highlights, but we must mention some of the important players in the game, such as Flamengo's defensive duo, Léo Pereira and Fabrício Bruno. The two were essential to Fluminense's low number of shots inside the box (<b>4</b>), adding up their statistics, we have <b>14 duels won</b>, <b>9 clearances</b>, <b>8 interceptions</b>, and only <b>1 dribble suffered</b>. </p> <p align="justify"> As for the tricolor, we can highlight Lima, a key player in Fluminense's midfield, who played in basically every area of the pitch. He was the player who touched the ball the most (<b>99</b>) and yet managed to maintain a very high quality of passing (<b>93% success rate</b>). As well as Marcelo, who played at left-back in a more attacking way, hitting <b>4 long balls right</b> and making <b>2 tackles</b>. </p> </div> <h2>Nova Iguaçu x Vasco</h2> <div style="text-align: justify"> <h3>Match Analysis</h3> <div style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-03-20-post_carioca_semifinal_2/en/game2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p align="justify"> On the Vasco side, the situation became increasingly complicated for the team's fans, who witnessed their team being eliminated from the championship with no chance of making the final a Clássico dos Milhões. In the match, although Vasco had <b>66% possession</b> and <b>5 shots on goal</b>, they failed to convert any of their <b>11 shots</b> at the end of the 90 minutes. </p> <p align="justify">On the other side, Nova Iguaçu, despite not dominating possession, posed more of a threat to Vasco's defense, attempting <b>14 shots</b>, <b>6 of them on target</b>, and converting one chance. Additionally, they intercepted two times more than Vasco (<b>42 vs. 18</b>) and regained possession within an average of <b>24 seconds</b> after losing it, almost half the time compared to the Cruz Maltino's average (<b>42 seconds</b>). </p> <p align="justify">Nova Iguaçu thus surpassed Vasco to reach the final of the Carioca Championship for the first time in their history. As a result, "A Laranja Mecânica da Baixada," as their fans call them, will face Flamengo on March 31st and April 7th for the title that crowns the King of Rio de Janeiro. </p> <h3>Highlights</h3> <div style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-03-20-post_carioca_semifinal_2/en/players2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p align="justify">Playing for Vasco, Dimitri Payet was the team's highlight in another of our analyses.

The Ace Laboratory Football Team dives into the decisive matches, from Flamengo's dominance over Fluminense to Nova Iguaçu's unexpected offensive power trying to overcome the Vasco's "Wall", offering an exciting glimpse into the tournament's electrifying action. </p> </div> <h2>Fluminense x Flamengo</h2> <div style="text-align: justify"> <h3>Match Analysis</h3> <div style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-03-15-post_carioca_semifinal_1/en/flaflugame.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p align="justify"> Fluminense played a match below expectations against Flamengo, being constantly pressured, and failing to impose their style of play. This was the 1st match of the 2024 Carioca Championship in which the team ended the match with less ball possession than its opponent <b>(49% x 51%)</b>, with a weak performance from its attack, which did not make any shots to the goal defended by goalkeeper Agustín Rossi. Furthermore, the team committed a total of <b>11 errors that led to shots</b> in the game, and until this match, they had committed <b>31 errors</b> in the entire championship. </p> <p align="justify"> The rubro-negro, who had their greatest strength in the defensive sector, demonstrated that they also have high offensive capacity, making a total of <b>23 shots</b> in the match, with <b>9</b> of these shots being on Fábio's goal. If we consider the team's approximate time with the ball, we have a rate of <b>1 shot every 2 minutes</b> in possession of the ball. </p> <p align="justify"> The data showed complete dominance by Tite's team on the field, both in the defensive and offensive sectors, Flamengo created and did not let the opponent take advantage of the few chances they had. Fluminense will have a difficult job to qualify for the finals, scoring 3 goals against a team that only conceded 1 goal in the entire championship, for the next match coach Fernando Diniz will need to change his strategies, and possibly behave more aggressively if he wants to guarantee his place in the final. </p> <h3>Highlights</h3> <div style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-03-15-post_carioca_semifinal_1/en/flafluplayers.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p align="justify"> One of the ways to see how Fluminense played defensively was the positioning of Jhon Arias, a player who normally acts as a winger in an offensive way, ended up staying for most of the game on the tricolor field, playing on the right flank as a defender and unable to exploit his best qualities, his dribbling and his important passes. </p> <p align="justify"> Another point was the number of saves that goalkeeper Fábio had to make from shots from inside his area <b>(5)</b>, showing how effective Flamengo's creation was, and in large part this was due to Nicolás De La Cruz. The midfielder made a total of <b>6 key passes</b> for his team, playing mainly on the left side of the field, the side where the club took the most shots. </p> <p align="justify"> It is also worth noting the performance of striker Pedro, who took advantage of his team's opportunities, scoring <b>1 goal</b> at the end of the match, and making a total ofv<b>6 shots</b>, with <b>3</b> in the goal, having the opportunity to increase the score, if it weren't for the good performance of goalkeeper Fábio. </p> </div> <h2>Vasco x Nova Iguaçu</h2> <div style="text-align: justify"> <h3>Match Analysis</h3> <div style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-03-15-post_carioca_semifinal_1/en/vasconovaiguacugame.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p align="justify"> The two teams engaged in a match that, despite having only two goals, was marked by a large number of shots from both sides. The total number of shots is impressive for a semifinal match, especially when considering that the clash between Flamengo and Fluminense had only 31 shots, nearly 1.5 times fewer than the encounter between Vasco da Gama and Nova Iguaçu, which featured 45 shots total by the end of the game. </p> <p align="justify"> For Vasco, the offensive game was unusual, considering that the team has an average of 10.8 shots on goal in their last 5 games, yet they managed to shoot 21 times, with only 7 shots directed at goalkeeper Fabricio. Vasco’s midfield also demonstrated a lot of creativity reaching the attack, tallying 16 key passes throughout the first 90 minutes of the Carioca Championship semifinal. </p> <p align="justify"> For Nova Iguaçu, on the other hand, it was not a game much different from the usual experience in their last 5 games, as the team’s average number of shots in the Carioca Championship is 17 shots per game. The data observed in the match also shows the preference of Nova Iguaçu to shoot from outside the box, with more shots from outside <b>(13)</b> than from inside <b>(11)</b>, creating a lot of work, for the opposing goalkeeper. </p> <h3>Highlights</h3> <div style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2024-03-15-post_carioca_semifinal_1/en/vasconovaiguacuplayers.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p align="justify"> Undoubtedly, it was a highly contested match with several chances for both teams, and in this context, it is essential to highlight both the main chance creators and the main defenders of each team. </p> <p align="justify"> On Vasco’s side, with an incredible performance, the Frenchman Dimitri Payet stood out with an 88% pass accuracy rate, with 5 key passes executed solely by the former Olympique Marseille midfielder. Simultaneously, in the defensive sector, the attacking midfielder was also fundamental, with 12 duels won by the Cruz-Maltino and possessing a very participative heat map on the left side of the defensive third of the Gigante da Colina. </p> <p align="justify"> In a game with many shots and above-average performances, attackers who had good performances like Carlinhos, who shot on goal 5 times, were overshadowed by the miraculous performances of both teams' goalkeepers. Léo Jardim made incredible 14 saves, with 9 of these shots from inside the box, representing a total of 93% of balls saved, and even conceding one goal was considered the MOTM. While Fabricio, Nova Iguaçu's goalkeeper, despite "only" making 6 saves, with 50% of them coming from shots from inside the box, successfully completed 80% of long balls launched for the team's possession in the field, a characteristic that is increasingly needed in today's goalkeepers. </p> </div> <h2>Final Remarks</h2> <div style="text-align: justify"> <p align="justify"> The first two games of the semifinals are in the books. Flamengo has the advantage, and Fluminense will need a much better performance to reverse the score. Vasco, despite being saved by Leo Jardim's great performance, will need at least a simple victory to guarantee their place in the final. Nova Iguaçu, on the other hand, has the advantage of a draw. </p> <p align="justify"> The Ace Football Laboratory team will continue to follow the Carioca Championship, bringing detailed analysis of the games and the players.

This saga, marked by unyielding courage, monumental breakthroughs, and a shared quest for equality, resonates with the spirit of today's celebrations. It was in Paris, at the dawn of the 20th century, that 39 pioneering women first made their mark in the annals of the Olympics. Amidst a societal backdrop heavily shadowed by restrictive norms, these audacious women ventured into sports such as golf, tennis, and sailing, setting the stage for a revolution in the realm of athletics. From the silken swimsuits of the 1912 British swim team to the defiant establishment of the Women's Olympiad in the '20s, each leap forward was both a triumph over adversity and a step towards greater inclusion. Yet, it wasn't without setbacks. The 800m run controversy of 1928 and the subsequent exclusion of women from these events. </p> <p align="justify"> From the silken swimsuits of the 1912 British swim team to the defiant establishment of the Women's Olympiad in the '20s, each leap forward was both a triumph over adversity and a step towards greater inclusion.
