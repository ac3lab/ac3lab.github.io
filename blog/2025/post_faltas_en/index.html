Personal fouls generally occur in situations of illegal physical contact and, throughout the game, accumulate consequences: each player is eliminated after committing 6 personal fouls, and when a team reaches the fifth collective foul in the same quarter, the opponent automatically enters the bonus situation, receiving free throws on any new defensive foul. Technical fouls are called for unsportsmanlike conduct or behavioral violations, such as excessive complaining or delaying the game; their punishment is 1 free throw and ball possession for the opponent, and the player or coach who accumulates 2 technicals is automatically ejected. Finally, flagrant fouls, applied to contacts considered violent or excessive, result in 2 free throws and ball possession for the opponent, in addition to counting as a personal foul: at level 1 (Flagrant 1), the player is only ejected if he commits two; at level 2 (Flagrant 2), ejection is immediate.</p> <p>Free throws are an essential component of scoring and can reflect the offensive performance of players and teams throughout the regular season. In the last four seasons, the player with the highest points per game average also led in free throws made per game: <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/players/traditional?Season=2024-25&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;dir=A&amp;sort=FTM" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Joel Embiid was the leader in 2021-22, 2022-23 and 2023-24, while Shai Gilgeous-Alexander took that position in the 2024-25 season</a>. Additionally, in the 2024-25 season, of the 10 teams with the highest free throw differential — calculated as free throws made per game minus free throws made by the opponent — 8 qualified for the playoffs, evidencing that the ability to convert free throws is an important factor for both individual performance and collective team success.</p> <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"> <div> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-10-09-faltas/nba_ftm_difference.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="NBA Free Throw Difference" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>A peculiarity of fouls in basketball is that they can be strategically exploited, as in the case of Hack-a-Shaq, a tactic that emerged in 1978 and became popular when Don Nelson, coach of the Dallas Mavericks, applied it against Shaquille O’Neal, giving rise to the strategy’s name. The goal of Hack-a-Shaq consists of committing intentional fouls on an opposing player with low free throw efficiency, forcing them to shoot free throws instead of allowing normal offensive flow. Although Shaq is the most famous example, the strategy has been applied to other great players, such as Dennis Rodman, Ben Simmons and, in the recent playoffs, Mitchell Robinson, center for the New York Knicks, who converted only 45.2% of his free throws, well below the NBA average of 77.7% in the 2024-25 season.</p> <p>In the series between New York Knicks and Boston Celtics, won by the Knicks 4-2, center Mitchell Robinson became the central target of the intentional foul strategy. Despite his low free throw efficiency, Robinson recorded an offensive rating of 116 — a statistic that measures how many points a player generates for the team per 100 possessions. However, if he were forced to go to the free throw line on every possession, the Knicks would have an offensive rating of only 90.4 in the series, which shows how the strategy could, in theory, significantly reduce the team’s offensive efficiency. On the other hand, applying Hack-a-Shaq has trade-offs: besides eliminating transition attack opportunities, it forces defenders to accumulate fouls, running the risk of being eliminated when they reach the limit of six personal fouls. Even so, the Celtics coach took this tactic to the extreme, committing intentional fouls even before the team was in the bonus, just to reach the five collective fouls faster and force Robinson to go to the free throw line.</p> <p>In conclusion, fouls in NBA basketball go far beyond simple game interruptions: they shape strategies, define the pace of games and can be both a defensive resource and a weakness exploited by the opponent. Between the impact of personal fouls on bonus accumulation, the discipline required to avoid technical fouls and the severity of flagrant fouls, to the application of tactics like Hack-a-Shaq, it becomes clear how this element of the rules is central to the league’s identity. More than punishments, fouls represent strategic choices that directly influence the outcome of a season.</p> <h2><b>NFL</b></h2> <p>Fouls in the NFL, due to their intensity, have received numerous changes over time. The league, created in 1920, based its game on college football and maintained its initial rules for 12 years. It was a mix between Rugby and the American Football we know today. Due to evolution, it became necessary to create fouls and penalties for the game, to reduce recurring injuries and concussions in football. <a href="https://operations.nfl.com/updates/football-ops/concussions-decrease-to-historic-low-in-2024-nfl-season" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">According to data released by the league itself</a>, the number of concussions in 2024 decreased by about 17% compared to 2023 and 13% compared to the 2021-2023 period.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/Posts_Images/2025-10-09-faltas/nfl_concussion.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Number of NFL Concussions by Year" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>The image shows the number of concussions per year, including preseason and regular season.</p> <p>Today the NFL has 3 main types of fouls:</p> <ul> <li> <b>Technical fouls:</b> Related to positioning, or illegal formation.</li> <li> <b>Personal fouls:</b> Player behavior, illegal tackles (defensive play to try to take the ball and/or bring down the attacker) and dangerous actions.</li> <li> <b>Procedural fouls:</b> False start (leaving before the ball), offside (being ahead of the ball line).</li> </ul> <p>Each type of these fouls has its specific markings and penalties:</p> <ul> <li> <b>Holding:</b> One of the most common infractions. It occurs when a player illegally holds an opponent to prevent their advance.<br> <b>Penalty:</b> Loss of 10 yards for the offending team. </li> <br> <li> <b>False start (illegal movement before the snap):</b> Occurs when an offensive player moves before the play begins, without the snap having been executed.<br> <b>Penalty:</b> Loss of 5 yards. </li> <br> <li> <b>Offside (across the line before the snap):</b> Happens when a defensive player crosses the line of scrimmage (the line that determines where the ball starts in the play) before the play begins.<br> <b>Penalty:</b> Loss of 5 yards. </li> <br> <li> <b>Pass interference (interference with the pass):</b> A foul committed when a player illegally prevents an opponent from completing or intercepting a pass.<br> <b>Penalty:</b> Advance to the point where the foul occurred. </li> <br> <li> <b>Roughing the passer (aggression against the quarterback):</b> Occurs when a defensive player hits the quarterback after throwing the ball in an unnecessary or dangerous manner.<br> <b>Penalty:</b> 15-yard advance and automatic first down. </li> <br> <li> <b>Targeting (targeting the head or neck):</b> One of the most serious infractions, happens when a player uses the helmet to hit the opponent's head or neck.<br> <b>Penalty:</b> 15-yard advance and ejection of the offending player. </li> </ul> <p>Not all fouls will result in loss of yards, they can result in nullification/replay of the play, automatic first downs. Roughing the Passer and Targeting fouls are considered serious, and in addition to penalizing, they are reviewed by the league. These fouls have become much stricter, due to injuries and protection of the Quarterback (the passer, and generally, the team’s main player).</p> <p>A difference compared to other sports is how foul dynamics work: The team that suffered the foul chooses to accept or reject the foul. Let’s imagine the following scenario:</p> <p>Team A is on third down (third attempt to advance out of four total), needing 4 yards to achieve the necessary 10. The play begins and they manage to score a touchdown from that play, but there was a false start foul by team B. Team A has two options:</p> <p>Option A: Accept the foul. Since they accepted the foul, the penalty is applied relative to the line of scrimmage. Since they needed 4 yards for the first down and false start equals 5 yards, they automatically get the first down.</p> <p>Option B: Reject the foul. If they reject the foul, what counts is the play that occurred as a result, regardless of whether team A advanced or not. In this case, if they reject it, the score that counts is the touchdown, since that was the result of the play.</p> <p>Unlike tactical fouls made in football and basketball, American football does not have this type of foul, because of the nature of the sport; a more static and less fluid and continuous sport like football and basketball. However, fouls can cause psychological impacts on players and affect their performance on the field.</p> <p>NFL fouls were much less restrictive than they are today. As it was a sport with less equipment, fouls were much more violent than they are today, and this made the image that was propagated of the sport be that of a brutal and violent sport. Between 2015-2024, only 3 seasons have less than 200 injuries and concussions, including Preseason and Regular Season (2020, 2021 and 2024). The NFL today is protecting its players and athletes more, so that more people with college dreams and adults can play without having to worry about a permanent injury in the future, and so that spectators can be captivated, not by violence, but by the beauty of the sport.</p> <h2><b>FOOTBALL</b></h2> <p>In modern football, the line between a punishable infraction and a strategic play is becoming increasingly thin. Data and tactical analyses from different teams [Manchester City and the Art of the Tactical Foul] show that committing fouls is no longer necessarily a disadvantage. On the contrary, in many contexts, the calculated breaking of rules has become a valuable tool for controlling the game.</p> <p>A look at the Premier League shows exactly this: in recent years, there is no clear correlation between the number of fouls committed or suffered by a team and their success in the league table. The key, therefore, is not in quantity, but in the quality and context of each foul. <a href="https://www.premierleague.com/en/news/4187343" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Arsenal is an emblematic case: frequently one of the teams that suffers the most fouls in the English Championship</a>, the London team has transformed this statistic into a weapon. With the expertise of set-piece coach Nico Jover, the team has become one of the most dangerous in the world in free kick situations, converting these interruptions into concrete goal opportunities.</p> <p>But this is far from unanimous, the golden rule, as midfielder Jack Grealish highlighted in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EX_2r9-bAP0" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">interview</a>, is location. “If you suffer a foul here (in the central third of the opponent’s field), that’s fine, because it can be useful for the team, but if we’re in our own field, you want to try to stay on your feet”, explained the player. It is this logic that feeds the famous “tactical foul”, a play increasingly present in high-level football.</p> <p>Teams that abuse counter-attacks are constant targets of these strategic interruptions before midfield. The intention is clear: to break the offensive rhythm and prevent the construction of dangerous plays. <a href="https://blogarchive.statsbomb.com/articles/soccer/decision-making-and-expected-value/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Studies</a> further reinforce the advantage of committing fouls far from “danger zones” which, in most cases, are close to the final third of the field. Thus, the “faster” the foul is committed in counter-attack situations (where progress is made quickly on the field), the better.</p> <p>This dynamic creates a paradox within the four lines. The foul, which by definition punishes attitudes prohibited by the game, becomes a strategic component incorporated into the game. The result can be a “choppy match”, with frequent interruptions that benefit specific teams to the detriment of fluidity and spectacle. For players, the repetition of fouls also shapes perceptions. An athlete constantly interrupted may be unfairly labeled as a “diver”, when, in fact, their quality in retaining the ball and attracting marking makes them a frequent target.</p> <p>It is noted then that football becomes increasingly complex, where each foul is also a control tool, a defensive weapon and, for prepared teams, the starting point for a deadly attack. In the end, the limit of the rule becomes just the starting point for strategy.</p> <h2><b>CONCLUSION</b></h2> <p>In summary, the comparative analysis of fouls in the NBA, NFL and football reveals that, far beyond mere rule violations, they are strategic elements deeply integrated into each sport’s identity. In basketball and football, “more fluid” sports, fouls shape the pace and outcome of matches, being used in a calculated way in tactics such as the “tactical foul” or even “Hack-a-Shaq”. In the NFL, penalties have evolved to prioritize athlete safety, creating a complex system of choices that can alter the course of a match.</p> <p>Thus, it is perceived that foul rules transcend their original punitive function. They have become dynamic tools that teams master to gain competitive advantage. Whether to control the pace, exploit an opponent’s weakness or protect players, the strategic management of fouls is a reflection of the tactical sophistication and constant evolution that define high-performance sport today.</p> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2025/chelsea_psg_en/">Chelsea vs PSG: Blues Stun French Giants to Claim Club World Cup Crown</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2025/real_psg_en/">Real Madrid vs PSG: French Dominance Secures Club World Cup Final Spot</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2025/flu_chelsea_en/">Fluminense vs Chelsea: Brazilian Underdogs' Fairytale Run Ends in Semifinal</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2025/real_borussia_en/">Real Madrid vs Borussia Dortmund: A Champions League Rematch on the World Stage</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2025/chelsea_palmeiras_en/">Heartbreak and Heroics: Palmeiras Faces Chelsea in a Quarterfinal Thriller</a> </li> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 ACE Laboratory.
