<h2>Introduction</h2>

<div style="text-align: justify">
<p align="justify">
In a week with a double round that happened between 16/04 and 18/04, good games were played and the top 4 has changed considerably. For this round, we have Flamengo, Internacional, Juventude and Bragantino.

On Wednesday, Flamengo and São Paulo faced each other at Maracanã in a rematch of Copa do Brasil’s 2023 final. This time around, the rubro-negro managed to maintain control during most of the game, only losing its grip after 70 minutes played, when the Tricolor finally got some chances and scored once with Ferreirinha. Besides Flamengo’s good performance, we can highlight Nico de La Cruz, who again showed he’s essential for the team in defense and playmaking.

<p align="justify">
At Barueri Arena, Internacional beat Palmeiras 1x0 with Wesley scoring. Palmeiras got a lot of game volume, but was inefficient when shooting, having lower than 17% shots hit (3 shots on goal with 18 total). On the other side, Internacional was way more efficient, though having lost a penalty kick, hitting higher xG than Palmeiras, even with few opportunities.

<h2>Juventude x Corinthians
</h2>

<div style="text-align: justify">

</div>

<p align="justify">
Juventude played Corinthians home at Alfredo Jaconi Stadium. Though having dominated for some time in the match, Timão’s low efficiency gave space for their opponent to grow in production. As result, Juventude took advantage of two bad moments of goalkeeper Cássio to open 2x0 in the first 15 minutes of second half, conquering their first win at Brasileirão.

<h2>Red Bull Bragantino x Vasco</h2>

<p align="justify">
Red Bull Bragantino faced Vasco in a very even match at Nabi Abi Chedid, winning 2x1 home. Bragantino’s goals were scored by Laquintana and Vitinha, while Vegetti lowered for the Gigante da Colina. RB Bragantino, though having won the match, had certain linearity in xGoals during the game. On the other side, Vasco lost at least one clear chance, losing the match even though they had more xG than their opponent.
