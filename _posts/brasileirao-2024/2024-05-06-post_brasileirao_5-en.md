<h2>Introduction</h2>

<div style="text-align: justify">

<p align="justify">
Round 5 of the Campeonato Brasileiro has come to an end, and it was a shorter one, with 3 games postponed. We'll continue our coverage of the top 4 teams in the round, analyzing the games of Athletico, Bahia, Botafogo and Atlético-MG.

At the Nilton Santos Stadium, Botafogo hosted Bahia in a very busy match. In the first half, both teams scored, despite a relative dominance by Bahia, who had the best chances of the match so far (xG of 1.75 against 0.22). However, we saw a very different second half, with Botafogo clearly dominating their opponents in almost every aspect (possession, chances created, shots on goal). Unfortunately for Botafogo, Bahia managed to get through the pressure without conceding, and in the 86th minute Rafael Ratão scored for the visitors, confirming an important away win.

At the Ligga Arena, Athletico Paranaense hosted Vasco in an almost one-sided match. Furacão managed a simple victory, with only a goal scored by Erick in the first half. However, the sending off of Vasco midfielder Hugo Moura in the 16th minute was a determining factor in the match. In the first half, Athletico attacked more and accumulated 1.65 xG, while Vasco ended the first half with 0.0 expected goals. In the second half, despite being down a player, Vasco went on the attack and balanced the match.

At the Kleber Andrade Stadium, Atlético-MG visited Fluminense, in a match marked by a heroic draw for the visiting team. Despite the balance during the first two thirds of the game, Fluminense were more effective than their opponents, scoring two goals and earning the chance to just manage the result they had built up. However, in the 73rd minute, the substitutions made by coach Gabriel Milito changed the course of the match and in just six minutes, Eduardo Vargas, coming off the bench, had already equalized for Galo. After the equalizer, Fluminense came under a bit of pressure, but the result held.
