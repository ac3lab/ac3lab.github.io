There’s been one unbeaten team in all competitions for exactly one year, since May 2023. Champions of their national league, finalists in their country’s cup and in the UEFA competition. In moments when it seems like this team is finally going to lose, they come back with an unshakeable determination, score goals in added time and maintain their unbeaten streak and sequence in championships. How did a team that hadn't attracted attention in soccer for a few years manage to become a top power in European soccer, with the longest unbeaten streak in history? In this series of posts, ACE Laboratory will analyze and identify the playing style of Bayer Leverkusen and their coach Xabi Alonso, aiming to uncover the reasons behind the magnificent run the team has done in 2024.<br/><br/>

<h3>Bayer Leverkusen without possession</h3>

In the defensive sector, Alonso's team applies high pressure during the opponent's build-up in a mid-block, forcing errors to regain possession. Depending on the match, the German champion can adopt two different formations while defending: a 5-2-2-1, pressing the opponent's build-up with five players, crowding the midfield, and forcing plays to the sides of the field where the wing-backs press and win the ball; or a 4-2-3-1, which allows for an easier transition out of defense after stealing the ball.<br/><br/>

Additionally, Leverkusen employs counter-pressing, commonly known as Gegenpressing. Xabi needed only a few months to shape and solidify this defensive tactic, establishing one of the most robust defenses in the league. By April 2024, they had achieved nearly 54 recoveries per match using this tactical approach.<br/><br/>

</div>

The team also conceded the fewest goals in the entire Bundesliga, allowing only 24 goals, proving the efficiency of their playing style.<br/><br/>

<h3>Bayer Leverkusen with possession</h3>

Classified as a middle ground between Pep Guardiola's positional play and the relational play seen in Fernando Diniz's Fluminense, Xabi Alonso trains the team for a build-up that depends on the current formation on the field. The playing style, which involves many passing exchanges, is evident in the team's passing network, where we can see the formation of "triangles" that allow multiple options for a player to work the ball.<br/><br/>

<div style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;">

</div>

Often, the wing-back Grimaldo operates defensively on the left, leaving two central defenders and a right-back to create space on the field and allow for "third man combinations." In these combinations, two players (usually Xhaka and Palacios) quickly pass the ball between themselves to draw defenders, creating space for a third player (usually Wirtz) to receive the ball. This tactic is characteristic of the relational play style.<br/><br/>  

The use of this tactic is evidenced by the number of passes made by Bayer, the highest in the Bundesliga in the 2023-24 season. Additionally, the four advanced players move a lot, preventing the opposing defenders from pushing up their defensive line.<br/><br/>

<div style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;">

</div>

However, it is also common to see the team building up play with three defenders, utilizing the flanks with advanced wing-backs (usually Grimaldo and Frimpong), midfielders and forwards giving closer non-positional options, through midfield with quick transitions to attack generally architected by Wirtz or with direct passes from the defense to the attack into the empty spaces created by the team’s movementation. This is exemplified by the high number of progressive passes per game.<br/><br/>

</div>

If the opponents remain too rigid centrally, the team starts forming narrow diamond patterns, allowing Bayer to continue doing their short and dynamic passes to reach the final third of the field. Another possibility is that if the opponents press Leverkusen's short passing exchanges, the ball is moved to the opposite flank, which will have plenty of free space.<br/><br/>

Moreover, the German team doesn't rely solely on movement and masterful passing to score goals this season, since approximately 10% of all goals scored by Xabi Alonso's team have come from set-pieces. Additionally, goals from counter-attacks are also common for the German side when necessary.<br/><br/>

<h3>Final third of the field</h3>

The final third of the German team's attack is almost unpredictable. The advance of the wing-backs through the flanks mixed with midfielders infiltrating the box, along with a bit of accurate long-range shooting, create Xabi Alonso's magical formula for the team's incredible effectiveness. Thus, a statistic that demonstrates the unpredictability of the team led by the Spanish maestro is the percentage of attacks from each offensive third of the field, with the left, middle, and right accounting for 33%, 34%, and 33% respectively.<br/><br/>

Such offensive prowess not only leads to a flurry of goals and chances created for the German team but also contributes to the team's unbeaten streak, which, when being behind on the scoreboard, always finds a way, often through the tactics taught by Xabi Alonso, combined with a bit of luck, to score goals and maintain their unbeaten record intact for all season.<br/><br/>

</div>

A common tactic is as follows: when reaching the final third of the field, the wing-backs advance and the team's formation shifts to a 3-2-5, with the central players pushing up to receive the ball and create more options for playmaking, thus creating a numerical advantage that makes the team unpredictable and overwhelms the opposing defense. During this advancement, other players move up to occupy the midfield.
The team is so efficient that it ranks in the top 3 in chances created from open play, but in comparison, has few chances from set-pieces.<br/><br/>

<h3>Weakness</h3>


Due to the relational play, if the team loses the ball in the attacking side and fails apply quick pressure, the opponent has a lot of space on the flanks of the field (where the full-backs should be), since the players concentrate in a compressed manner for effective passing combinations and triangles. However, if the midfielders in transition cover the flanks, the central area becomes weakened and opportunities arise for the opponent. The system relies entirely on the players' perfection and minimizing errors. An example of this was observed in the away game against Qarabag, where both goals conceded were due to possession losses and effective counter-attacks by the Azerbaijani team.<br/><br/>

</div>

But, as we can see by the team’s results in the season and their goal difference stats, the risk is worth taking.
