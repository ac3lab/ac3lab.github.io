<h2>Introduction</h2>
div style="text-align: justify">
<p align="justify">
FIFA dates are excellent times for national teams to adjust their tactical schemes and try out new players. During this period, the Brazilian national team faced England in their first friendly match, and we're going to analyze the teams' performances and the main highlights of the match.

<h2>England x Brazil</h2>
<div style="text-align: justify">
<p align="justify">
On this FIFA World Cup date, the Brazilian national team faced an even greater challenge, with a new coach, injured key players and the weight of a poor season last year. This is a short period of training and adjustments, but the importance of playing a friendly against a top team and the need for victory spoke louder, and even with all these obstacles, Brazil created chances and managed to beat England by the minimum score, with a goal from Endrick, who was one of the highlights of the match.

On the other side, England, who have been working harder with a longer-serving coach and a more settled team, but who also had a lot of injured players, were unable to beat the Brazilian national team. The English national team hadn't lost a game since 2022, when they were knocked out of the World Cup in the quarter-finals by France.
