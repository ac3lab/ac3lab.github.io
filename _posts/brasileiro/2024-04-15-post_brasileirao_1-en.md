<h2>Introduction</h2>

<div style="text-align: justify">
<p align="justify">
One of the most competitive leagues in the world, Brasileirão started this weekend (13/04). We at ACE Laboratory will, in every round, analyze the teams that find themselves in the top 4. For the first round, we brought the matches from Athletico-PR, Cruzeiro, Flamengo and Vasco.

In the most unbalanced encounter of the 1st round, Athletico and Cuiabá faced each other at Ligga Arena. The “Furacão” had an impressive display, and we can see they dominated the match when we analyze that Cuiabá only shot once in 90 minutes. Offensively, Athletico was great, managing an easy win of 4x0.

<p align="justify">
At the round’s most active match, Cruzeiro and Botafogo played a very interesting match for the supporters in Mineirão. Cruzeiro imposed their way of playing, which can be seen by analyzing the passing network and the number of shots (15). On the other side, Botafogo couldn’t have game volume, having only 6 shots.

<p align="justify">
Sunday Atlético-GO and Flamengo faced each other at Estádio Serra Dourada. In a match full of controversies by the referees, we can still highlight the great performance by Atlético, who played with 10 men for the entire second half, and still managed to offer more danger than their opponent (shown by the greater xG during all 90 minutes, specially during the second half). Though the less than expected performance, Tite’s men managed to win by 2x1.

<h2>Vasco x Grêmio</h2>

<div style="text-align: justify">

A balanced match between Vasco and Grêmio, the team from Rio won with their supporters in São Januário. An important highlight in this match is the difference between first and second halves. In the first 45 minutes, Vasco was the star, scoring two goals. While on the second half, Grêmio was way more offensive and had great chances of drawing the game. Looking at the xG timeline, it’s easy to see that Vasco’s attack kept almost linear during the match, while Grêmio was sharper in the last half.
