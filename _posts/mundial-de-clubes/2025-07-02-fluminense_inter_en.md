<h2> <b> Introduction </b></h2>

<div style="text-align: justify">

In our last post about Fluminense after the group stage, we stated: "the Flu had both defensive failures and wasted goal opportunities, which should be crucial points for improvement in the next game". In this knockout match against Inter Milan, it seems the tricolor understood the message. <br/><br/>

Renato Gaúcho bet on a different formation, with a 3-5-2. In the first minute of the match, Fluminense's high pressing was already causing discomfort for goalkeeper Sommer, who shares a ball with Germán Cano. A few minutes later, after a series of passes, Fluminense overloaded Inter with four players inside the penalty area, setting up a cross for Cano, who, free, becomes lethal again and scores the first goal of the match, putting Fluminense in an excellent position. <br/><br/>

<h3> <b> Match Summary </b></h3>

After the goal, Fluminense didn't panic. The Italian team kept the ball at their feet, ending the first half with 66% possession, but without causing major problems for the tricolor, who intercepted their shots very well, both in defense and in goalkeeper Fábio's hands. Additionally, Renato's team was the one that came closest to the second goal still in the first half, with a wasted chance from Samuel Xavier after an impressive play by Arias. This play, along with Ignácio's disallowed goal, demonstrates that, despite having less possession, Fluminense definitely didn't back down from the game. <br/><br/>

Accumulating only half the number of passes from Inter at the end of the first half (126 to 250), it was the Rio team that showed more sharpness, ending the first half with 5 shots against Inter's 5. Dimarco, who wears number 32, was responsible for three of them. See the possession from Inter's passing network: <br/><br/>

In the second half, Fluminense continued in this style — Renato, in fact, ended the game with a substitution to spare. Inter, however, showed they wanted the game, making changes that had an effect: from the 60th minute onwards, the team brought much danger to Fluminense, shooting an incredible 10 times. The tricolor fan certainly held their breath seeing the three great chances created by Inter, one wasted by de Vrij, another from Lautaro that stopped in Fábio, and one more from Lautaro in the same minute that hit the post. These three shots alone add up to 0.52 xG. <br/><br/>

Who closed the tricolor's house was the match's star, Ignácio, who won 10 of the 15 duels he contested. This pressure suffered can be observed from Fluminense's PPDA (Passes per Defensive Action) chart: <br/><br/>

<h3> <b> Tactical Analysis </b></h3>

Renato Gaúcho's tactical change to 3-5-2 was fundamental for Fluminense's success. This formation allowed greater control of the midfield and better defensive coverage, especially against Inter's technical quality. <br/><br/>

Fluminense's defensive system worked exceptionally well, with the three defenders providing extra security and the full-backs offering offensive width when necessary. The high pressing at the beginning of the match caught Inter by surprise and resulted in Cano's early goal. <br/><br/>

Ignácio's performance was particularly notable. The player not only won most of the duels but was also crucial in defensive organization and offensive transition. His versatility allowed Fluminense to maintain tactical structure even under intense pressure from Inter in the second half. <br/><br/>

<h2> <b> Conclusion </b></h2>

However, qualification was destined for the Warriors team, who killed the game at Hércules' feet in stoppage time, to confirm an extremely conscious and deserved victory. <br/><br/>

Fluminense demonstrated significant tactical evolution compared to previous games. The change to 3-5-2, combined with a more aggressive approach at the beginning of the match, was fundamental to neutralizing Inter's quality. The team showed maturity in managing the result, even under intense pressure in the second half. <br/><br/>

After this victory, fans may have been excited about the possibility of revenge against Manchester City. However, the Club World Cup has shown that it never tires of surprising, and Fluminense now has a match scheduled against Al-Hilal for Friday, which will very likely be their biggest challenge so far. <br/><br/>

The performance against Inter demonstrates that Fluminense is growing in the tournament and could be a surprise in the next phases. The combination of defensive solidity, offensive efficiency, and tactical adaptability makes the tricolor a fearsome opponent for any team. <br/><br/>
