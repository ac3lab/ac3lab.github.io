### The Historical March of Women's Olympic Aspirations

<p align="justify">
As 2024, an Olympic year, draws near, and on this International Women's Day, we take a moment to honor and reflect on the remarkable journey of women in the Olympic Games. This saga, marked by unyielding courage, monumental breakthroughs, and a shared quest for equality, resonates with the spirit of today's celebrations. It was in Paris, at the dawn of the 20th century, that 39 pioneering women first made their mark in the annals of the Olympics. Amidst a societal backdrop heavily shadowed by restrictive norms, these audacious women ventured into sports such as golf, tennis, and sailing, setting the stage for a revolution in the realm of athletics.
From the silken swimsuits of the 1912 British swim team to the defiant establishment of the Women's Olympiad in the '20s, each leap forward was both a triumph over adversity and a step towards greater inclusion. Yet, it wasn't without setbacks. The 800m run controversy  of 1928 and the subsequent exclusion of women from these events.

As we marvel at these visual testaments of progress, it's clear the journey is far from over. Even as we acknowledge the soaring participation rates and celebrate the barriers broken, our data reveals a patchwork of investment in female athletes across nations. Some countries lead with burgeoning enthusiasm, while others reveal a hesitance to embrace the full potential of their female contenders.
