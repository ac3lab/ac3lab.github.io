We can say that Flamengo's highlight in this championship was its defensive sector. The team conceded just 1 goal in the 11 matches of the competition, being the 3rd team with the best rate of duels won <b>(40.1%)</b> and the 2nd best if we only consider aerial duels <b>(49.4%)</b> . This security in duels, added to the quality of the players, made Flamengo the club that made the fewest mistakes that led to shots <b>(31)</b> and the one that took the least shots <b>(79)</b> from opponents, with more than 15 shots difference from 2nd place.
</p>

<p align="justify">
With Giorgian De Arrascaeta in midfield, Flamengo's offensive work was also impressive, the player is **above the 3rd quartile** in 6 of the 7 offensive categories we observed, being in the Top 10 of the championship in goals, assists and passes key. The rubro-negro likes to dictate the game and with that he managed to create many opportunities, he was 2nd with the most possession of the ball <b>(57.8%)</b>, 1st in the rate of successful crosses <b>(43.3%)</b> , 1st in goals scored <b>(23)</b> and 1st in shots <b>(178)</b>, with more than 20 shots ahead of 2nd place.

With this we saw Flamengo's dominance in the 2024 Carioca Championship, the team proved to be solid defensively, being the one that conceded the least goals, and solid offensively, being the one that scored the most goals. With the quality of their players, Flamengo will be favorites for the semi-final against Fluminense, and will be looking for the title undefeated.

<p align="justify">
The Nova Iguaçu team surprised many with the second-best performance in the league stage of the Carioca Championship. The team does not have a good average in overall defensive metrics, having the lowest possession average among the qualified teams <b>(7th in the entire league)</b>, the highest foul rate, and conceding a total of thirteen goals. The key factor for Nova Iguaçu's victories was capitalizing on their shots on goal and converting chances into goals.

Midfielder Bill was the standout player for the team in the competition. The athlete ranked <b>1st</b> in assists, key passes, and successful dribbles for the team, highlighting his importance throughout the championship. The radar chart below also illustrates the player's versatility in defense, playmaking, and finishing.
</p>

<p align="justify">
With 24 points, seven wins, three draws, and only one defeat, the "orange mechanical" team from the Baixada qualifies for the semifinals and eliminates one of the Rio giants. Just like in the league stage, Nova Iguaçu will need to capitalize on their chances to surprise Vasco and reach the final of the Carioca 2024.
</p>

<h2>Vasco</h2>
<div style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;">

Vasco da Gama's championship was marked by its attack, ranking as the <b>2nd</b> highest-scoring team in the tournament with a total of 20 goals. With a team that maintains ball possession and precision in its passes, Vasco was the <b>3rd</b> team with the most possession <b>(55%)</b>, 3rd in passes <b>(5290)</b>, and 3rd in pass accuracy <b>(87.7%)</b>.

Looking at the radar chart, we can see that the player plays a crucial role in creating and finishing plays. Payet was a fundamental piece for Vasco during the league stage and will be essential for the team in the semifinal against Nova Iguaçu.
</p>

For the semifinals, Vasco will need to maintain the quality that its midfield and attack have shown in the recent matches of the tournament to avoid surprises and secure a spot in the final of the Carioca 2024.

<h2>Fluminense</h2>
<div style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;">

Midfielder Jhon Arias was a fundamental part of the tricolor squad, having an offensive characteristic, the player was the team's leader in key passes <b>(16)</b>, and 8th in the entire competition, which did not correspond to more goals, given that the club scored the fewest goals in the G4 <b>(17)</b>. The club's attack was not satisfactory, being 7th in shots <b>(143)</b>, Fluminense demonstrated that despite the great exchange of passes, it did not create real opportunities, which resulted in a low number of goals.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Despite the quality defense, the Tricolor attack did not keep up with the performance that its midfield created. This became more evident in the classics, where Fluminense scored just 1 point from the 9 played, scoring 2 goals and conceding 6, more than half of what they conceded in the entire championship. Recopa champions, Fluminense will have work to do if they want to guarantee their third Carioca 2024 championship.

</p>

<p align="justify">
Taking less control of the game, Botafogo preferred to leave the ball with the opponent, being the only team from the Big 4 in Rio to have possession of the ball less than 50% <b>(49.6%)</b>, 5th in the championship in exchange of passes <b>(4357)</b>, 6th in the accuracy of these passes <b>(84.67%)</b> and 10th in accurate crosses <b>(30.9%)</b>.
